            "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">As you Craft your memoir, you inscribe your tale into its pages. By putting these words to magical paper with psychically resonant ink, you carve your legend into the Astral Plane itself. When you’re destroyed, your soul flees to your memoir and rebuilds your undead body over the course of 10d10 days. Afterward, you manifest next to the <em>astral memoir</em>, fully healed and in a new body (lacking any equipment you had on your old body). Each time a creature reads your memoir while you are rebuilding, the time it takes for you to rejuvenate is reduced by 10 days.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upon the completion of your <em>astral memoir</em>, its contents are imprinted into the Astral Plane in the form of your <em>astral legend</em>. This legend is the true source of your immortality, and can only be destroyed in a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">psychic duel</span> or by traveling to your mindscape through the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.8MAHUK6jphbME4BR]{Mindscape Door} ritual. While within the mindscape, your <em>astral legend</em> uses your statistics, can’t leave the mindscape by any means, and is permanently destroyed if reduced to 0 or lower hit points. Your <em>astral legend</em> can’t be destroyed unless your physical body has also been destroyed and has not yet rejuvenated. You cannot enter your own mindscape; however, should it be under attack, it is recommended for the GM to have you control your <em>astral legend</em> during the fight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the physical memoir is destroyed while your astral legend survives, the physical memoir gradually reforms over the course of 1d10 days at a site central to your history (such as the library where you first studied magic or the battlefield where you vanquished a powerful rival). It typically reappears hidden among other books or treasures, where an unwitting dupe might begin reading the text and hasten your return. You cannot begin reforming until your psychic memoir has reformed completely, and lay dormant until then.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike other types of lich, you remain largely unaltered if your <em>astral memoir</em> is destroyed; if it is not intact, you lose access to one spell slot of each level you can cast. If your astral legend is destroyed, however, you are instantly destroyed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Craft Requirements</strong> You have Lich Dedication and have chosen the Astral Echo path.</p>"
