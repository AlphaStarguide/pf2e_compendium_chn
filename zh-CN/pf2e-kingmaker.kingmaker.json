The Cult of the Bloom calls their cavern hideout the “@UUID[Scene.ncT9uFiw6hj5zyDh]{Cradle of Lamashtu},” and it was here that the cult leader Darivan created the <em>monstrous bloom </em>ritual.</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.feVqesGobG3L2VZO]{Darivan} didn’t simply pick these caves at random—he was guided here by his visions for this was one of the few places that the first <em>monstrous bloom</em> ritual could even be attempted, due to the presence of a breach scar.</p><h3>Breach Scars</h3><p>First World breach scars occur when the barriers between the Material Plane and the First World are worn thin by overuse of powerful conjuration magic, a malfunctioning portal between the two planes, magical “erosion” in the underlying structure of reality, a disruptive convergence of shifting ley lines, or another unusual magical effect. Despite the wide range of features that can cause breach scars, they remain incredibly rare events, and the fact that the First World itself works to heal these scars over time means that even when a breach scar does form, it almost never persists for more than a few years.</p><p>The breach scar in these caves is an exception to this rule, for before it could heal properly, it became “infected” by a taint from the Abyss when, several decades ago, a demonologist tried to capitalize on the fragility of reality to redirect the scar from the First World to the Abyss. The resulting backlash of magic obliterated the demonologist, but it did infect the breach scar and make it such that it simply couldn’t heal on its own.</p><p>Fortunately, the corrupted breach scar wasn’t enough to allow unaided intrusions across the planes, and so for years it simply festered in the caves until its presence was discovered by chance by a wandering druid named @UUID[Actor.jmH2nbWRJSYgzx5z]{Jin Durwhimmer}, who noticed the strange fluctuations after performing a commune with nature ritual in the nearby foothills. He investigated, was shocked at what he found, and attempted to heal the breach scar on his own, but the same magical backlash that slew the demonologist lashed out at him, blasting away his arm. Jin died soon thereafter, his attempt to heal the scar worse than failing, for it was this pulse of energies that caught the attention of another: Darivan.</p><p>When he arrived at the caves, Darivan didn’t try to redirect or remove the scar’s energies; instead, he harnessed them and developed the monstrous bloom ritual to weave both the First World and the Abyss into a singular monstrosity—a bloom of Lamashtu. This discovery was the key to his plot to spread the curse through the region, and as long as this sinister sorcerer lives, his curse continues to threaten the Stolen Lands.</p><section class=\"event\"><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>@UUID[Item.Odw3e7gbcYifaU6M]{Lamashtu’s Bloom}</h3><h3>Curse 7</h3></header><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Conjuration</li><li>Curse</li><li>Disease</li><li>Magical</li></ul><p>While some NPCs become afflicted by Lamashtu’s bloom curse during @UUID[.JO9Ouc5E80T9t2Al]{Parts 1} and @UUID[.yTJR4dc9eSM3RkZ5]{2} of this chapter, during Part 3 the PCs may be exposed to it as well.

                            "text": "<p>The @UUID[Scene.ncT9uFiw6hj5zyDh]{Cradle of Lamashtu} is a sizable cavern with a single entrance in the side of a sheer cliff wall where the rugged foothills of the Tors of Levenies transition into a jagged mountainscape. Little in the surrounding terrain gives away the true nature of what awaits discovery inside the caverns themselves.</p><p>Inside, the caves are warm and humid as a result of the breach scar. Water condenses on the walls and pools on the floor, and as the caves themselves slope gently upward overall, this condensation constantly drains out of the cavern entrance in tiny little trickles. Mold grows on many surfaces and in many colors, and the air smells musty with an unpleasant undercurrent of decaying plant matter. The first time breathing PCs enter the Cradle, they must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:15] save to avoid becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{sickened 1} by the foul smell, after which they are temporarily immune to the scent in the Cradle of Lamashtu for 24 hours. The caverns are lit dimly by softly glowing patches of phosphorescent fungi, and ceiling height averages at a roomy fifteen feet.</p><h2>The Breach Scar</h2><p>The breach scar itself suffuses the entire cave complex with its energies. To heal it, the PCs must defeat the @UUID[Actor.vBugpZnpxQcrrWoo]{bloom of Lamashtu}, as the Abyssal corruption from the scar itself was largely drawn out to empower the evil plant’s creation. Until the plant is slain, the humidity, warmth, and awful smell in the caverns will persist. Yet these are only minor side effects to the scar’s true and insidious danger.</p><p>As a result of the scar, the Cradle of Lamashtu exists in two realities at the same time. One of these is within the Material Plane (where the Cult of the Bloom dwells) and one is within the First World (where several dangerous monsters have been attracted to the caverns). The cultists and the dangers from the First World have come to terms with one another and either avoid or (in the case of the redcaps in area @UUID[.ZdQyuYOnpymgddRR]{C8}) have allied with each other.</p><h3>Shifting Realities</h3><p>The Cult of the Bloom drew upon energies from the First World and the Abyss to create their curse, and these energies infuse the Cradle of Lamashtu. At your discretion, you can present the encounters in these caves as shifting between realities—now and then giving the PCs glimpses of strange skies above where a cave ceiling loomed only moments before or dense walls of vegetation instead of cavern walls. If you wish, you could even have additional foes manifest in the caverns from the First World on repeat visits!</p><h2>Bypassing Stone walls</h2><p>Two key areas in the Cradle of Lamashtu, areas @UUID[.0vwdBqlpNDa5LVVv]{C9} and @UUID[.UHndNmZpoN3RxYuB]{C10}, lie beyond walls of stone that the PCs must bypass. Even if the PCs lack magic like shape stone or dimension door, they can always attempt to smash through the walls (56 hp, 14 hardness).</p><p>Some parties might have difficulty figuring out that there is more to explore beyond what appears to be a solid wall; the manifestation of Jin’s ghost at area @UUID[.oPylN6newPYt1TLh]{C4b} and Darivan’s journals at area @UUID[.9MW5AICUBHxif75j]{C7} are meant to serve as clues to the PCs that these walls hide secrets, but if you find that your players are having trouble progressing beyond these walls, feel free to have Jin’s ghost be clearer in his hints, or add in a few scrolls of <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.McnPlLFvKtQVXNcG]{shape stone}</em> as additional treasures in area @UUID[.qHYJenUzQbK03Urs]{C5}.</p>",

Upon their death, though, Virthad reverts to their true form as a doppelganger, which shocks, frightens, and shames the goblins significantly. See Greengripe’s Future below for the ramifications of this revelation.</p></section><h2>Greengripe's Future</h2><p>The Kingmaker Adventure Path assumes that the PCs take a less violent route. If the PCs manage to save the goblins and successfully expose Virthad for the monster they truly are, the future of the goblin village of Greengripe lies very much in the PCs’ hands.</p><p><strong>In the unlikely event that Virthad is captured alive</strong>, the doppelganger’s attitude is hostile, but they can be convinced to give up the cult’s location if the PCs manage a <strong>critical success</strong> at @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd]{Coercing} them; magical solutions may work at your discretion. Virthad takes advantage of any opportunity to escape and return to the cult.</p><p><strong>If the PCs slaughter the goblins</strong> or scatter them to the wilds, it’s likely that Virthad escapes the attack, in which case the PCs might find themselves at a dead end in tracking down the cult. It’s possible to find Virthad’s tracks and follow them all the way to the cult’s actual hideout; doing so requires a success at a @Check[type:perception|dc:20|traits:action:search] check made while @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Searching} to notice the doppelganger’s footprints leaving the village, at which point it’s a @Check[type:survival|dc:20|traits:action:track] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.EA5vuSgJfiHH7plD]{Track} them all the way southeast to the cult’s lair in encounter site @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.x9akvOBdMxgcO2xg]{SH8}. This DC increases to DC 30 if the PCs don’t immediately start following the trail, and if they haven’t started following the trail within a week, the prints can no longer be followed. If the PCs don’t Claim the hex and rebuild it, the village falls into ruin in time; at your discretion, a more powerful monster might move in at a later date.</p><p><strong>If Virthad is defeated</strong>, the goblins of Greengripe are thankful and their attitude becomes friendly to the PCs; they promise to work with them and help them in reward for saving them from the pretender. At this point, @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.eATwgXlHtXmEU16S]{Greengripe’s Negotiation DC} drops from 25 to 15, and as such, the PCs will have a much easier time establishing diplomatic relations with the village. While the goblins are still shocked that a doppelganger infiltrated their village, they quickly rally to the cause and volunteer to scour the region for clues to help the PCs track down the cult’s actual hideout; as a result, the PCs can track the doppelganger at once as detailed above without having to attempt the Perception check to find the footprints. The PCs can, of course, still discover the cult lair on their own (such as by tracking a fleeing Virthad, simply stumbling upon the cult site while exploring, or by achieving a threshold of 50 RP by researching the cult), but each day after the PCs’ defeat of Virthad, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:20]; this DC drops by 3 each day that follows. On a success, the goblins discover the location of the cult’s lair at area @UUID[JournalEntry.5QajqjVS7Dm8u7hi.JournalEntryPage.x9akvOBdMxgcO2xg]{SH8} and report their findings to the PCs as soon as they can.</p>",

The goblins’ morale breaks once at least 10 goblins are slain, at which point the survivors abandon the village and flee into the wilds, never to return. At some point during the fight, the true danger in Greengripe—the doppelganger Virthad—abandons the site and stealthily makes their way back to the cult’s hidden headquarters, expecting that the PCs will leave Greengripe believing (incorrectly) that they’ve stopped the curse.</p></aside><p>The majority of Greengripe’s goblins are very low level, and even in large groups, they’re likely to be a trivial encounter at best for a 6th-level party.

When you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.NpVIqD3LgI0Kb9RA]{Build a Structure} in a lot, you must select a lot in that block.</p><p><strong>Town</strong>: Once your kingdom is 3rd level and you’ve filled all four lots in your village, as long as your settlement is not Overcrowded (page 543), the next time you Build a Structure in a lot, you may choose a lot in any block adjacent to your current block. As you do so, your village becomes a town. A town consists of 2 to 4 blocks of 4 lots each. The blocks must be contiguous, but they need not be a square—they could form a T, L, or S shape if you like. When your kingdom gains its first town, gain 60 kingdom XP as a milestone award.</p><p><strong>City</strong>: Once your kingdom is 9th level and you’ve filled in at least two lots in each of your town’s 4 blocks, if your settlement is not Overcrowded, you may choose a lot anywhere on the Urban Grid when you Build a Structure in a lot. The first time you do so, the town transitions into a city. When your kingdom gains its first city, gain 80 kingdom XP as a milestone award.</p><p><strong>Metropolis</strong>: When your kingdom reaches 15th level and you have filled at least two lots on each block in your city, if your settlement is not Overcrowded, you may expand into a metropolis by adding a second Urban Grid. (You may instead continue filling in the remaining lots and remain a city.) At this point, you can place new structures into any lot you wish in the newly added Urban Grid. You can add additional Urban Grids each time you have built at least two lots of structures in every available block and are not Overcrowded, but there are no further settlement types beyond metropolis to achieve. When your kingdom gains its first metropolis, gain 120 kingdom XP as a milestone award.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>This indicates the maximum number of blocks the settlement can occupy in an Urban Grid.</p><h3>Population</h3><p>A settlement’s exact population is intentionally left abstract, but if you wish to estimate the numbers, you can use the values here as guidelines. Population density increases as a Settlement grows. In a village, each completed lot has an average population of 100 people or less. A town’s average population increases to 125 people per completed lot, whereas a city’s average population per lot increases to around 700. A metropolis can have an average population per completed lot of 1,000 people or more.</p><h3>Level</h3><p>The settlement’s level generally falls within the range listed here, and is always equal to the number of blocks that have at least one structure (to a maximum of 20). A settlement level is separate from the kingdom level and is primarily used to determine potential jobs in the settlement (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 504). A settlement’s level also suggests what sort of magic items might be commonly available for purchase at shops or the market (subject to GM adjudication).</p><p>In the Pathfinder RPG, a settlement’s level is used primarily to determine potential jobs on offer for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j]{Earn Income} activity, and to determine what level of items are commonly available for sale in that community. For the purposes of Kingmaker, it’s easiest to assume that a settlement created by the PCs using these rules has a settlement level equal to the number of blocks on the settlement’s Urban Grid that are completely filled, but you should feel free to adjust these levels as makes sense for their campaign. The levels assigned to NPC settlements in this book (such as Restov, Varnhold, and Pitax) have been set as appropriate for the storyline and are not determined by the number of full city blocks.</p><h3>Consumption</h3><p>Consumption is a numerical value that indicates the Food commodities the settlement requires in order to remain viable and functional. The number given here shows the settlement’s base consumption; specific structures in the settlements can increase or decrease its Consumption.</p><h3>Maximum Item Bonus</h3><p>Many structures within a settlement grant an item bonus to specific kingdom activities. Normally, item bonuses do not stack, but if you build multiple structures of the same type in the same settlement, their item bonuses stack up to this limit. In a case where two settlements have overlapping influences from identical structures, only the higher item bonus from a single settlement’s structures applies.</p><h3>Influence</h3><p>A settlement’s influence area is the area around a settlement where meaningful economic and productive activity can occur, as well as where the settlement’s beneficial effects extend. The numeric value indicates the number of hexes that the settlement’s influence extends. Thus, a village only influences the hex it’s located in, while a town influences all adjacent hexes. If a settlement has only Water Borders and no Bridges, that settlement’s influence is 0 regardless of its settlement type.</p><p>Certain activities and the impact of some kingdom events are limited to a settlement’s influence. Structures in a settlement that provide a specific item bonus do so to all of the claimed hexes influenced by their settlement. (Structures in your capital city provide that bonus to all of the kingdom’s claimed hexes, regardless of the capital’s influence.)</p><p>Hexes not claimed by your kingdom are never part of your settlements’ influence areas, even if they are within the distance noted above. A hex can be influenced by multiple settlements.</p>",

While an arena or cathedral might stand alone as a towering edifice, most lots represent a number of buildings whose focus is to support the type of improvement that lot supports. For example, a brewery could represent a collection of brewers and bottlers and the families who support them, while a luxury merchant would represent several specialized stores. Even sprawling, sizable improvements like dumps, cemeteries, or parks might include nearby dwellings or cottages for those who tend and manage the area or live along its margins.</p><p><strong>Residential Lots and Overcrowding:</strong> While almost every structure presumably includes a small amount of lodging, you need to build Residential lots in order to give your citizens enough places to live. You do so by building a structure that has the Residential trait in a chosen lot. Settlements require a number of Residential lots equal to the number of blocks that have any structures built within them, although these residential lots need not be located one per block. For example, when a village expands to a town, it initially occupies 2 blocks. It needs 2 Residential lots in total among those 2 blocks, either both in one block or one in each block. A settlement without this minimum number of Residential lots is Overcrowded (mark the “Overcrowded” box on your Urban Grid) and generates 1 Unrest for the kingdom during the @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.WWGNrRZ1dkTjz5Il]{Upkeep phase} of each Kingdom turn.</p><p><strong>Reduced to Rubble:</strong> It’s possible for structures in a settlement to be reduced to rubble by a failed attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.rw2BHBpLyh5Xvqw5]{Demolish} a structure or a poor result from a kingdom event. When a structure is reduced to rubble, replace the lots the structure once occupied on @UUID[.y7f0lbubZNDW5Zhj]{the Urban Grid} with rubble. Having rubble in a lot doesn’t itself impact a kingdom’s Unrest or other statistics negatively, but it does prevent you from building in those lots. You must Demolish that lot before you can build there again. When a single lot that contains part of a multi-lot structure is reduced to rubble, each of the lots that contained that structure are replaced with individual lots of rubble.</p><h2>Structure Descriptions</h2><p>Structures are described in the following format.</p><header class=\"split underlined\"><h3>STRUCTURE NAME</h3><h3>Level</h3></header><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Trait 1</li><li>Trait 2</li></ul><p>A structure’s level indicates the minimum kingdom level required to build it. Each structure has traits that convey its properties. The <strong>Building</strong> trait indicates the structure is a collection of indoor sites, while the <strong>Yard</strong> trait indicates the structure is primarily an outdoor site. <strong>Infrastructure</strong> indicates that the structure benefits all lots in an Urban Grid without occupying a lot. (For a metropolis, this means you’ll need to build Infrastructure separately for each Urban Grid that makes up the settlement.) The <strong>Edifice</strong> trait grants its benefits to a settlement only once; if you build that structure an additional time in the same settlement, it’s purely cosmetic. A <strong>Residential</strong> structure helps house the settlement’s citizens; a settlement requires at least one Residential lot per block to avoid being Overcrowded. The <strong>Famous</strong> trait increases your Fame score when the structure is built, while the <strong>Infamous</strong> trait does the same for your Infamy score. Some structures have both Famous and Infamous traits; in this case apply the one that matches your kingdom’s preference (see @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.mriZ3uO2ggsPpA2y]{Fame and Infamy}). A short textual description rounds out the top of the structure stat block.</p><p><strong>Lots:</strong> The number of contiguous lots that the structure occupies on the Urban Grid; <strong>Cost:</strong> The cost in RP and Commodities (if any) you must spend before attempting the Build Structure check.</p><p><strong>Construction:</strong> This entry lists the required skill, proficiency rank, and DC for the Build Structure check.</p><p><strong>Upgrade From/Upgrade To:</strong> Some structures can be upgraded into a more advanced form of the existing structure, such as upgrading a Shrine into a Temple. If you upgrade a structure, subtract the RP and Commodity cost used to build the original structure from the cost of the new structure. When the new structure is complete, its effects replace those of the previous structure. You can’t upgrade a structure to one that occupies more lots if there isn’t space in the block for the new structure’s size. (You do not need to build the lesser form of a structure before you build the advanced form.)</p><p><strong>Item Bonus:</strong> This entry indicates any item bonuses the structure grants to specific activities made within the settlement’s influence—or within the borders of your kingdom if the settlement is your capital. These bonuses are item bonuses, but they stack with those granted by identical structures within the same settlement, up to that settlement’s maximum item bonus (@UUID[.tqqHYzVPfsyDsoiC]{Settlement Statistics}).</p><p><strong>Ruin:</strong> Some structures negatively impact society. If this structure does so, it will increase one or more of your kingdom’s Ruins when constructed; this increase only happens once, when the structure is built. Increases to Ruin in this way aren’t removed if the structure is later demolished.</p><p><strong>Effects:</strong> All additional game effects the structure grants to your kingdom are listed here. In many cases, these effects grant item bonuses to PCs while they are in the settlement, but unlike those granted by the Item Bonus above, item bonuses found in this section of the stat block do not stack with other item bonuses. Unless stated otherwise, effects in this section apply only within this settlement; they do not apply to areas influenced by this settlement.</p><h2>Settlement Structures</h2><p>Presented over the following pages are stat blocks for a wide range of structures that serve a variety of purposes in settlements, both to bolster kingdom statistics and PC resources.

The grid divides a settlement into 9 large districts (blocks) arranged in a 3-by-3 square. Each district itself comprises 4 individual neighborhoods (lots) arranged in a 2-by-2 square. It is these neighborhood lots in which you’ll build structures to improve your settlement.</p><p>While the Urban Grid diagrams your settlement as a square, this is simply an organizational abstraction—it doesn’t mean that your settlements are literally square. If it helps your sense of verisimilitude, feel free to cut up the Urban Grid and arrange blocks of four lots in any shape you wish. For a city hugging the shores of a great bay, you could draw out the bay and simply paste the blocks in a long row lining the coastline, or in any other arrangement that suits your taste.</p><p>Though the Urban Grid depicts 9 blocks for each settlement, the number of blocks in which you can build is limited by the settlement’s category: a village consists of only a single block (and can thus host a maximum of only 4 lots of structures), while a city can expand to all 9 blocks (and can host up to 36 lots of structures). It’s even possible for your settlement to become a metropolis, expanding to more than one Urban Grid! (See @UUID[.tqqHYzVPfsyDsoiC]{Settlement Types} for complete details of settlement categories.)</p><h3>Urban Grid Borders</h3><p>The four sides of the Urban Grid are where you record the types of borders your settlement has.</p><p><strong>Land Borders</strong>: By default, all of your settlement’s borders are unremarkable transitions from urban to hinterland—these are known as Land Borders.</p><p>You take a cumulative –1 item penalty on Trade checks for each settlement in your kingdom that has no Land Borders, unless it has at least one Water Border with a Bridge.</p><p><strong>Water Borders</strong>: When you place a settlement in a hex that has lake, river, or swamp terrain, you can locate it so that it has Water Borders. Water Borders provide natural defenses to your settlement during Warfare, and some structures can only be constructed in lots adjacent to Water Borders. However, crossing Water Borders that lack Bridges takes a long time (see Navigating an Urban Grid below).</p><p>If a settlement has only Water Borders, it is on an island; until you build at least one Bridge, that settlement’s @UUID[.tqqHYzVPfsyDsoiC]{influence} is 0.</p><p><strong>Walled Borders</strong>: Building Walls on your borders boosts your settlement’s defense in certain events and in Warfare.</p><h3>Navigating an Urban Grid</h3><p>You can simulate travel in a settlement using the Urban Grid to approximate distances. Since moving through a settlement requires a character to follow twisting roads, navigate crowds, or endure minor distractions along the way, it takes 15 minutes to move from one lot to an adjacent lot, or to cross a border (including exiting the settlement). If the settlement has Paved Streets, this travel time is reduced to 5 minutes. Crossing a Water Border that doesn’t have a Bridge takes an hour.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Water borders in the Strategy Maps</p></header><section class=\"spotlight\"><article class=\"flex50\"><p>With the 57 maps included in this module, and the flexibility offered by rotation, it is possible to represent any configuration of water and land borders.</p><p>If you need to quickly tell how many water borders a given map has, take a look at the key at the end of its name- the number refers to how many water borders it has.

You'll notice that if you double-click on one of the tokens, you'll just get an error message, instead of seeing a character sheet. If you'd like to use these scenes as the basis of one of your own, you can just delete and replace those tokens with real ones.</em></p><section class=\"spotlight\"><article><h2>The Structures Browser</h2><p>This module includes a full set of enhanced assets that can be used to depict every type of structure that is described in the following pages. These can be easily navigated and sorted through using a tool called the <strong>@UUID[Macro.pRoIP31HeNZUcTxu]{Structures Browser}.</strong></p><p>You can access the <strong>Structures Browser</strong> by running the above macro- it's also visible to your players, though you'll need to give them the Create Actors permission (see below) to let them make full use of it.</p></article><figure class=\"right flex50\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/journal-kingdom/tutorial-settlement-browser.webp\" /><h3>The Structures Browser</h3></figure></section><p>The Structures Browser presents a gallery of buildings, with the option of filtering by size (in lots), sorting alphabetically or by level, and toggling between the original artwork and the new enhanced artwork that was made for this module. Selecting a building populates further information in the right hand panel, including a brief description and a link to the structure's associated journal entry. In some cases, such as the Waterfront, there are even multiple pieces of artwork for a given structure- in that case you can cycle through the options by clicking on the arrow buttons beneath the showcase image.</p><p>When you click on the \"Create Structure\" button, the Structures Browser will create a new merchant actor in your world using the currently selected artwork. The application will also set the name, token settings, and so on appropriately. When you're ready to use it, you can place it on your scene just as you would any other token.</p><h3>Customising Buildings</h3><p>Each building is linked to its own specific actor, so you can customise them individually to add some extra flavour to your settlement- for example, renaming a newly created \"Inn\" to \"The Downy Alpaca\", or a newly created Luxury Store to \"Belter &amp; Hoggs\".</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Setting Permissions</p><p><a href=\"https://foundryvtt.com/article/users/\">Knowledge Base: Users and Permissions</a></p></header><p>If you want your players to be able to create their own buildings, you'll need to grant them the permissions to create new actors and drag tokens for those actors to the canvas. Navigate to the Game Settings tab of the sidebar, click on Configure Settings, and then click the Configure Permissions button located near the top of the window. You'll want to grant the permissions \"Create New Actors\" and \"Create New Tokens\". You may wish to check the box for \"Configure Token Settings\" as well.</p><header><p>FAQ: Why use tokens and not tiles?</p></header><p>Using merchant actors instead of tiles to display this artwork has a lot of benefits- it allows them to have a nameplate, and gives you a quick way to populate them with items if you'd like to turn them into a functional shop. However, the main benefit is that, unlike tiles, players can create, place, move, rotate, and generally customise placed tokens, which can help to give them a much greater feeling of control over the exact appearance and layout of their settlement.</p></section><h2>Decorating a Settlement Scene</h2><p>In addition to the assets for buildings, the Kingmaker module also includes a selection of decorative <strong>Settlement Tiles</strong> that can be used to add roads, bridges, trees and more to your settlements. You can easily find these assets by selecting the Tile Controls in the left-hand toolbar and using the @UUID[Macro.cc5mT4qK9ldh2tT5]{Browse Settlement Tiles} macro. Do note that because these are tiles and not tokens, the GM will need to be the one to create and position these tiles.</p><p>As with everything else in this module, you should feel free to use the assets however your group sees fit- but we do have a few tips to share that might help you to get the most out of them.</p><p><strong>Break The Rules</strong>: While the original Urban Grid map is laid out on a strict grid, a more naturalistic settlement layout is completely possible within Kingmaker's rules- your blocks don't have to be arranged in a 3x3 grid, nor do they have to be square. Instead, your settlement will look a lot more natural if it's build following the contours of of the terrain. It may help to place buildings before you start to add more structure through pathways, walls, and roads. You can even hold shift to place buildings entirely off of the grid, if you'd like!</p><p><strong>Hide Your Crimes</strong>: From time to time, the place where two tiles meet may not be ideal, leaving a sharp line. While we have provided \"end\" segments for roads and walls to provide a smoother transition, there may still be some cases where the edges of the tiles simply look odd against the background. Similarly, placing some buildings too close to existing trees on the scene may also look odd, as the trees should be above the buildings, not below them.</p><p>You can avoid some of these issues by layering assets, or concealing unwanted elements beneath other tiles. Notably, the various trees included in the decorative tiles can be an easy way to cover up any odd-looking edges for a more seamless view, and your players never need to know about the heinous crimes you've committed against aesthetic sensibilities.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>FAQ: How do I rotate 1x2 Buildings?</p></header><p>If you try to rotate one of the 1x2 buildings, you may find that the art rotates but the token's \"footprint\" does not. This is because the token's dimensions need to be changed- go into the token configuration, and set the dimensions to 2 squares wide by 1 square high, with a token scale of 2. This will allow for vertically aligned buildings to more cleanly snap to the grid without distorting the appearance of the building's image asset.</p><header class=\"split\"><p>FAQ: Why Can't I Pan the Canvas?</p></header><p>When placing tile assets during settlement building, you may find yourself in a situation where it seems like right-click to pan no longer works. This is likely because you've accidentally selected the large tile that serves as the scene's background image- you can deselect it with a simple left-click and drag.</p></section>",

This is the event the audience is anticipating the most, as it is one of the most traditional events—it has occurred in every Rushlight Tournament from the start, beating out the Midnight Joust by a year for that honor. Much speculation on the audacity and nature of the tales to be shared during the boast make the rounds in the days leading up to this event.</p><p><strong>Contest Rules</strong>: For this event, a wooden platform is built in the center of the Coliseum. In turn, each contestant takes this stage and boasts to the audience of one of their greatest accomplishments. The boast must last for 15 minutes and must consist of a beginning, a middle, and an end. The contest requires the boaster to take the Boast activity three consecutive times to determine how well they tell their tale and how the audience responds.</p><section class=\"skill\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Boast</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Auditory</li><li>Concentrate</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Linguistic</li></ul></header><p>You recount a crowd-pleasing tale, showing off something you and your allies may (or may not) have actually done—the story you tell just needs to be exciting. In this contest, a Boast consists of three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. To begin, the character introduces themselves and sets the scene for the story. The character then goes on to tell the bulk of the tale in the second part. In the final part they conclude with the story’s climax. In each part, the character can decide to:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li><p>Entirely make things up by attempting a @Check[type:deception|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Relate the events in a way that appeals to the specific audience’s interests with a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Present the story in an intense and frightening way with an @Check[type:intimidation|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Enhance the tale with their own storytelling craft with a @Check[type:performance|dc:31] check,</p></li><li><p>Impress the audience with fine details and bits of knowledge on the topic with a <strong>Lore</strong> check appropriate to the story’s topic.</p></li></ul><p>Boasting is meant to keep the audience enthralled and surprised, so the boaster must use a different skill check for each of the three parts unless they critically succeed at a check, in which case the audience loves that style of boasting so much that the boaster can use that check again for their next Boast check.</p><p>This particular contest is a 13th-level encounter, so in all cases, the DC for these checks is 31. If you wish to include Boasts in other encounters, you should use the appropriate DC by level.</p><ul class=\"outcomes\"><li><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The audience reacts with cheers, screams, and laughter as appropriate to the tale.

A few chuckles and screams and applause happen here and there. The boaster gains 1 Victory Point.</p></li><li><p><strong>Failure</strong> The audience is not quite bored, but also not quite engaged—awkward silences, coughs, and shifting in seats reveal the crowd’s growing disinterest.

Despite the audacity of Ankus’s claims, the crowd seems to be particularly excited and delighted by his tale.

At the end of each of Ankus’s Boast activities, allow each of the PCs to attempt a @Check[type:occultism|dc:33] or @Check[type:perception|dc:36] check to notice Ankus’s ringer behaving strangely.

King Irovetti has a strong dislike of the woman, as she has rebuffed his advances numerous times and seems to have no fear of speaking out against his rule in Pitax, yet the fact that she’s so well-loved by the populace and has won the boasting competition every year ensures her role—Irovetti would rather Pitax keep its crown in this contest than silence the bard. Annamede remains as charming and arrogant as she was when the PCs first encountered her during the hunt at the start of the Season of Bloom (see @UUID[JournalEntry.Kmwzfr7NS9r9Vhb0]{Chapter 5}). Since then, her fortunes in Pitax have grown considerably, and she’s gained five levels of experience since her previous encounter with the PCs. (If Annamede did not survive the hunt, her sister Ilemestra fills her role here; Ilemestra is antagonistic to the PCs as—rightly or wrongly—she believes their actions contributed to Annamede’s death.)</p><hr /><p><strong>Strategy</strong> Annamede’s boast should interest the PCs in particular, for she claims to have spent the past several months (or years, as appropriate for your campaign) spying upon the PCs’ kingdom. The nature of her boast varies. If the PCs didn’t particularly impress or befriend her in Chapter 5, she speaks of how she used her influence and skills to cause all sorts of misfortune in the PCs’ kingdom. You can cite specific events or developments from the past several sessions of play to make it seem like Annamede was the behind-the-scenes instigator of these events. If, on the other hand, the PCs impressed her in Chapter 5 by gaining at least 4 Influence with her, her boasts instead reveal how she aided the PCs’ kingdom behind the scenes, helping to prevent greater disasters or otherwise taking the credit for kingdom successes in the past several sessions. Whether or not these boasts are true, her knowledge of various embarrassing failures and problems the PCs have had with their kingdom should feel eerily accurate. At your option, if a particular PC made a significant impression upon Annamede (either negative or positive), she’ll throw out a specific insult or compliment as appropriate.</p><p>If Annamede’s boast is positive or complimentary to the PC’s kingdom, a PC can attempt a @Check[type:perception|dc:30] check to notice some pointed glances between Annamede and King Irovetti—she’s obviously enjoying how her compliments are making the king squirm.

At this point, four of the encounter areas presented in Chapter 2 become modified by the presence of field army encampments as detailed on the following pages. If the PCs defeat these four field armies, King Irovetti realizes he may have acted a bit rash and recalls his forces back to his capital city for an extended period of time, during which the PCs can @UUID[JournalEntry.Wu3fxKHhSPFO5TM9.JournalEntryPage.PbIpD7Fbgc4IyEQE]{infiltrate Pitax} in an attempt to end the war for good.</p><h2>Kingdom Turns during the War</h2><p>The Rushlight Tournament begins on the first Fireday of the month, so by the time it concludes and the war begins, the PCs should have a few weeks to react before the next Kingdom turn begins. When the war starts, Pitax has several different armies as listed below.</p><p><strong>Avinash’s Forces</strong>: These three armies are detailed as part of @UUID[.umSaG2ON6OcxfySj]{Irovetti’s First Strike}. If that War encounter ended with the PCs losing the hex, defeating Avinash’s remaining armies before the end of the month prevents them from spreading through the kingdom. If any of Avinash’s armies still exist when a Kingdom turn begins at the end of each month, one of his defeated armies (the GM chooses which) is replenished in the conquered settlement with new forces from Pitax, then each army moves one hex in a direction of your choice, automatically causing that hex to become lost as it is claimed by Pitax.</p><p><strong>Field Armies</strong>: These four armies of Pitaxian soldiers are located in areas @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.O8cuvFXBUssLzK03]{GL1}, @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.vwy930AkMwsvWYvO]{GL2}, @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.royVC8UEgzrekNYI]{PX1}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.GMOsLUes0rbLNRBv]{RU3}; Irovetti holds them back to help maintain control in Pitax’s zone. With the exception of the wyverns in Littletown, who do not leave that location, these armies can react to seek out PC armies within the zone, at your discretion. If a field army attacks the PCs in a hex other than their listed encampment, adjust the battlefield terrain as you see fit.</p><p><strong>Pitax Regroups</strong>: Once Avinash’s forces and the four field armies are defeated, King Irovetti orders his forces to regroup in his capital city. No further encounters with Pitaxian armies occur in the Stolen Lands for 2 months. After this point, if Irovetti still remains in charge, you can have new field armies or forces under Avinash’s command begin to threaten the PCs’ kingdom again, but this adventure expects the PCs to have dealt with King Irovetti personally by then.</p><h2>Wartime Fatigue</h2><p>War takes a toll on all kingdoms, more so when the fighting is active and close at hand. As long as the threat of Pitax’s armies remains, the PCs’ kingdom suffers as detailed below.</p><p><strong>Avinash’s Forces Are Raiding</strong>: If, when a Kingdom turn begins, Avinash’s forces are still active, with at least one of his armies undefeated in the PCs’ kingdom, the kingdom gains [[/r 1d6+4 #Unrest]] Unrest and increases a Ruin of the party’s choice by 2; the other three Ruins each increase by 1.</p><p><strong>Avinash’s Forces Were Defeated</strong>: If, when a Kingdom turn begins, Avinash’s armies have been defeated and the general has retreated into his palace in Pitax, the kingdom gains [[/r 1d4 #Unrest]] Unrest and increases a Ruin of the party’s choice by 1.</p><p><strong>Field Armies Were Defeated</strong>: If Avinash’s forces and all four field armies have been defeated, Pitax’s aggression against the PCs’ kingdom is dramatically reduced. In this event, at the start of a Kingdom turn, the kingdom gains 1 Unrest and does not increase any Ruins.</p><p><strong>King Irovetti is Defeated</strong>: Once the PCs defeat Irovetti (either by killing him, forcing him to abandon the region, or securing his surrender), the War of the River Kings ends and wartime fatigue penalties to the kingdom no longer accrue.</p><h2>Nature's Wrath</h2><p>Nyrissa doesn’t sit idly by as Pitax goes to war against the PCs. As the war unfolds, she warps reality within her domain to allow a horrific tempest to bleed through from the First World to strike at the PCs sometime during this part, hoping to further tax their resources and resolve.

A crown sits comfortably on his brow and an elegant cloak drapes his shoulders. His belt is thick with tools, weapons, and pouches, bespeaking an adventuring lifestyle not completely left behind. He also carries two strange pieces of equipment: The first and most impressive is a long staff of unusual metal, one end of which is fitted with thin blades and a spike that periodically shift and move with a soft whirring noise. The second is a thin, short rod of strange metal with a single spike at the end; small, circular lights periodically flash along the length of this rod.

For now, though, he wants the PCs to feel as comfortable as possible, and he has no intention of treachery. The food and wine he offers are safe and delicious, and the idle questions about how they and their kingdom fare are relatively meaningless. If the PCs ask him point blank about Drelev, he seems to be somewhat embarrassed and admits that “Lord Drelev was, shall we say, a bit too eager for his own good. He got what he deserved, and I’m only thankful that you put him down before he caused both of our kingdoms more damage.

To score points, the contestant’s arrow must make a solid hit, not only hitting the target but sticking into it—a shot that fails to do enough damage to overcome the target’s Hardness bounces off and does not stick. A critical hit on a target indicates a bull’s-eye. All shots must be taken in 6 rounds or the shooter is disqualified. Likewise, if no shots hit, the shooter is disqualified.

Merchants from numerous River Kingdoms come to hawk their wares at this event; traditionally, even Brevoy sends some representatives, although this year marks the first with no official Brevic presence as internal tensions in that nation are nearing a breaking point. Wandering merchants jockey for space, crying their wares, whether hot from a basket or cool from a cask. Stages with jugglers, minstrels, mummers’ troupes, and trained animals dancing and leaping all vie for the attention (and the coin) of the crowds reveling in King Irovetti’s bounty.</p><p>The festival begins on the first Fireday of the month (although you should feel free to adjust this date to anything that you wish to fit the realities of your Kingmaker campaign). The first day of the tournament is given over to trading, feasting, a preview of the beasts of the traveling menagerie, entertainment (of varying quality), and after sunset, a grand display of fireworks. The next three days are highlighted by contests at the Coliseum, then followed by a day of rest. Finally, on the sixth day, the tournament concludes with a nightlong celebration of wine in honor of Pitax’s many vintners, all culminating in the traditional Midnight Joust, after which the winner of the tournament is announced.</p><h3>Festival Locations</h3><p>The festival grounds themselves are laid out along Cutter’s Creek, a minor tributary of the Rushlight River. The major features of the festival grounds are described below; all of these locations can be visited at any time by curious PCs.</p><p><strong>Coliseum</strong>: All of the official tournament events take place in this large field of hard-packed dirt. The northern side of this large, open field has rows of bench seats for spectators. A noble’s box stands at the east end of the field; seating there is limited.</p><p><strong>Menagerie</strong>: This enormous purple pavilion is a showplace of tamed horrors and monstrosities from across Golarion. The mysterious Madame Duclarion (CN female human sorcerer 10) and her hulking handlers, the Brothers Ohka (CN male @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.gdXok08bITkhowDJ]{ogre warriors}), keep a charmed menagerie of dinosaurs, rare animals, and supernatural beasts culled from every land for the viewing pleasure of festival-goers. Madame Duclarion keeps her creatures (and her handlers) calm and controlled through judicious use of various enchantment effects.</p><p><strong>Rotunda</strong>: The Rotunda is where tickets to tourney events can be purchased; each day’s events cost as little as 1 sp for a single ticket to as much as 100 gp for a noble “box” suitable for seating up to 10.</p><p><strong>The Royal Blue</strong>: The buildings that surround this small lake are grand silk pavilions facing the water. These are reserved for the private use of visiting dignitaries from the other River Kingdoms, with flags flying above them marking the lands of their inhabitants. If the PCs accept their invitation to the event from Lord Irovetti, they are granted the use of the easternmost pavilion for the duration of the event.</p><p><strong>Royal Pavilion</strong>: This pavilion is used by the king. Irovetti keeps the pavilion protected with a private sanctum heightened to 8th level, so that anyone who peers into the tent sees only a dark, foggy mass.</p><p><strong>Staging Pavilion</strong>: This pavilion is used for competitors preparing for games or other competitions in the coliseum. The pavilion has several smaller areas formed by canvas walls around a central area for competitors to gather in before they emerge when announced for a competition.</p><h3>Tournament Security</h3><p>Many of Pitax’s most capable guards serve long hours as security. The bulk of these guards are the equivalent of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.npc-gallery.Actor.B13dyXTo1xWVyj2R]{palace guards} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.npc-gallery.Actor.TgeUj2IiyoTeZHIO]{watch officers}, but a more dangerous type of guard patrols the tournament grounds—and Pitax itself. These are the notorious @UUID[Actor.SaSXYUpSWIFHIzET]{Pitax Wardens}—battle-trained soldiers who augment their skill at swordplay with occult magic.</p><h3>Meeting the Competition</h3><p>This year, the participants consist of six kingdoms in all, including the PCs’ kingdom.</p><p><strong>Daggermark</strong>: Daggermark, as one of the most successful River Kingdoms, attends the competition out of a sense of duty, although their competitors are generally more interested in the entertainment than they are at actually competing for the prize.</p><p><strong>Gralton</strong>: The kingdom of Gralton has suffered long and hard to survive, and their reasons for competing this year are the same as every year: if they can win, the fame and glory and monetary awards will help their nation greatly.</p><p><strong>Mivon</strong>: Although Mivon’s relations with Pitax are shaky, with skirmishes common along their borders, the two nations are currently in something of a peace.</p><p><strong>Pitax</strong>: Although Pitax hosts the competition, its champions feel no shame or awkwardness over competing themselves.</p><p><strong>Tymon</strong>: The kingdom of Tymon is famous for its own competitions and gladiatorial battles. King Ungin sends representatives to all of the competitions and tournaments that occur in the River Kingdoms if he can, large or small.</p>",

It’s best if he targets a smaller settlement with at least one standing army in the same hex, so that the PCs can actually react to the fight and play out the battle as detailed below.</p><p>The PCs should hear about Pitax’s attack on their kingdom via a message, perhaps delivered by a spellcasting NPC from the settlement via something like <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.R9xqCBblkS5KE4y7]{sending}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.yM3KTTSAIHhyuP14]{dream message}</em>. You can then play out this War encounter in the context of a flashback.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><aside class=\"right noimage\"><h3>Armies</h3><ul><li><p>@UUID[Actor.pz4U2u7oUA76JlJm]{Pitaxian Raiders}</p><p>@UUID[Actor.s8Ol97yji6CbWt1l]{Tusker Riders}</p><p>@UUID[Actor.B9FuY1XYxU5SOcuI]{Wyvern Flight}</p></li></ul></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>War Encounter</h3><p>Severe 13</p></header></section><p>The forces Irovetti sends on this first strike consist of three armies: a warband of mercenaries, a band of mammoth-mounted hill giants, and a flight of wyverns. This force is expected to crush the PCs’ resistance, thus impressing on the players the seriousness of the situation, but it also represents the bulk of Irovetti’s field forces. The rest of his armies remain behind to fortify his territories (detailed in @UUID[.f6RD4Y7dVu6DZMsD]{Wartime Exploration}).</p><p>Irovetti’s armies are led by @UUID[Actor.VSffsyt5RONB4k2U]{Avinash Jurrg}, the commander of all of Pitax’s forces, and the defenders should witness the onidoshi acting during the battle—perhaps he’s using <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.3puDanGfpEt6jK5k]{cone of cold}</em> to blast foes, or he’s simply bellowing commands to foreshadow the PCs’ eventual confrontation with him later in this chapter—but he does not remain behind once the battle is over. Avinash isn’t particularly stealthy in his approach, and any defending armies should be able to march out onto the field to meet him before they reach the settlement. As a result, the assumption is this battlefield is open without unusual terrain, but if you wish to move the War encounter into the settlement, feel free to adjust this as you see fit.</p><p><strong>Loss</strong>: If the PCs’ forces lose the battle (or if they simply had no armies stationed near the attacked settlement), then Avinash’s remaining forces encamp in the settlement, claiming it and its hex for Pitax. In the coming months, Pitax attempts to expand their territory from this hex if left unchecked; see @UUID[.f6RD4Y7dVu6DZMsD]{Kingdom Turns during the War} for details.</p><p><strong>Victory</strong>: If Avinash’s forces are defeated, he abandons the field and flees back to Pitax to report to King Irovetti, who puts his city on the defensive for the next three months before they manage to rebuild forces enough to field another warband like this one to send into the PCs’ kingdom for further attacks.</p>",

Thick swaths of kudzu-like vegetation grow on the hill, and the wide path that once led up to the abbey itself is now little more than an overgrown trail. A low stone wall encircles the hill, built decades ago by the priests to delineate the land granted them by the church. This same stone wall now marks the extent of the Gardener’s influence—inside the wall, the air feels strangely thick and humid, almost as if the hill were under an immense greenhouse rather than on the slopes of a temperate mountain range. The Gardener’s influence manifests in other ways as well, causing vegetation to shift and writhe at times without an apparent breeze and causing weeds and vermin to grow to excessive size and strength. At night, the susurrus of the fields and vegetation rustling is unnerving in the still air, and languid fireflies the size of apples bob and dip in the air generating motes of sickly green and pale yellow light. A PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:nature|dc:25|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} confirms that the wilds seem unnaturally verdant here and that a magical influence is likely behind the hearty growth. A critical success on this check reveals that the boundaries between this world and the First World are thin in this region. Yet for all this eerie atmosphere, the Gardener himself does not manifest directly except in a few specific locations detailed in the encounter text.</p><p>Few signs remain of the expansive vineyards and grain fields that once surrounded the hill, although here and there, overgrown posts and tangles of wild grapes hint at the region’s past. The stone abbey looms at the hill’s peak; while the ruins of the winery stand to the south at the hill’s base. A long (now overgrown) trail winds down the hill from the abbey through the overgrown vineyard—once a scenic route intended to give the workers time to admire the regional beauty on each trip to and from the winery, but now a barely recognizable trail that winds up to area @UUID[.qL5wfLjAXQtJ8dZ9]{A1}. No map of the hill itself is provided, as beyond the encounters associated with the Abbey at its peak, the winery down on its lower slope, or the cavern below, no dangers exist on the now overgrown hillside.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Whiterose Hill is located at area @UUID[JournalEntry.btt2UVnNmyuPWfHF.JournalEntryPage.fnBr26RvgXnMKxXu]{GU2} of the Glenebon Uplands. With the Branthlend Mountains in the background, the hill itself is just one of many in the region, but it’s the only one in the whole of the uplands with a structure at its peak. As the PCs approach, hints of an overgrown trail become obvious in places. It’s merely a @Check[type:survival|dc:15] check to follow the path, which finally grows more distinct for a few hundred feet as it approaches the abbey plaza from the west—those who take the road come to area @UUID[.qL5wfLjAXQtJ8dZ9]{A1}.</p>",

Typically, the competitions last for a few hours, with the day’s winners announced at the rotunda in the Commons in the early evening.</p><p>Although King Irovetti serves as the arbiter and final judge for all of the events, his master of ceremonies, an unarmored Pitax Warden named @UUID[Actor.ZYhBJZZkMMLzlxl2]{Nunzio Arpaia} (N male human royal guard), handles all of the announcements, introductions, and commentary during the games. At some point on the first day of the ceremony, Nunzio approaches the PCs and briefly outlines the nature of the four events for them, describing them as “an archery contest using longbows, a test of strength using handaxes or greataxes, a boasting contest, and a drunken jousting competition.” He assumes the PCs’ kingdom will be participating in the tournament and needs to know who their competitors will be for each event, along with how each competitor wants to be announced at the start of each contest.</p><h3><strong>Contest Rules</strong></h3><p>The schedule of games is posted throughout the festival grounds. Each competition has its own rules, but there are three rules that govern all of the events: harm no spectators, kill no competitors, and don’t get caught cheating (canny PCs will note that “don’t cheat” is not a rule). Breaking any of these rules is grounds for disqualification from that event.</p><p>Each contest has a first-place winner and a second-place winner; those who don’t place first or second win no accolades at all and are instead mocked ruthlessly by the crowd after the competition. Contestants can always yield in a contest if they wish, although this does not lessen the mockery. Most of the contests are timed by the use of a large and extravagant water clock kept in the nobles’ palisade to the east of the coliseum.</p><section class=\"milestone\"><article><p><strong>First-Place Win</strong>: If the PCs win first place in a contest, they earn 2 Tournament Points, 80 XP, and 80 Kingdom XP.</p><p><strong>Second-Place Win</strong>: If the PCs win second place in a contest, they earn 1 Tournament Point, 40 XP, and 40 Kingdom XP.</p></article></section><p>The rules for each contest are outlined in the following pages.

In the test of the axe, each contestant is assigned to one of six fifteen-foot squares demarcated at each corner by a large upright log. The winner is the first contestant to hew through all four of their square’s logs using a greataxe. Similar to the archery competition, the four hours leading up to this event are filled with exhibition woodchopping from a wide range of would-be lumberjacks.</p><p><strong>Contest Rules</strong>: At the start, contestants are supplied with a greataxe and are then directed to take position inside their square. Nunzio holds a bright red flag up in the air, and when he lowers it, the six contestants can start hacking away at their logs (AC 20, Hardness 5, HP 20 [BT 10]) with their greataxe. Magic is allowed, but only to enhance an axe or its wielder—if the contestant damages or directly targets a log with something other than a greataxe or casts a spell on another competitor or their axe, they are disqualified.</p><p>It’s easiest to set up this contest in encounter mode, assigning each contestant a three-by-three grid of five-foot squares with the contestant starting in the grid’s center square and the logs in the middle of each corner square. The six grids should all be close together so that each contestant starts no more than 15 feet from at least one other contestant; some of the NPCs have tactics below that can affect other targets in range. Let the PC contestant choose whichever grid they want to be assigned to them (note that this contest is designed for Small or Medium contestants—larger contestants are not allowed, since they would have an unfair advantage). Once Nunzio lowers his flag, each contestant determines Initiative by rolling a Perception check, then attempts to chop through their logs as detailed in their Strategy section.</p><h2><strong>Contestants</strong></h2><p>The five NPC contestants are listed below, along with their strategies for chopping through their logs as quickly as possible.</p><section class=\"stats\"><aside class=\"right token\"><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/npc/yegina-varudu.webp\" /><ul><li>[[/r 1d20+25 #Perception]]{Perception +25}</li><li>[[/r 1d20+27 #Initiative]]{Initiative +27}</li><li>[[/r 1d20+25 #Will]]{Will +25}</li></ul></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>@UUID[Actor.c5sO9HYzpBeN8lRm]{Yegina Varudu}</h3><p>N female human sorcerer 12</p></header><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Daggermark</li></ul><p>Yegina looks rather small and frail, and she receives a fair amount of mockery during the early portions of this contest—mockery she heroically ignores with a smile on her face.

Riders may provide their own armor and gear, but they must use the weapon and shield provided. A heavy horse and a military saddle are provided for anyone who doesn’t have their own mount. Once all six contestants have their mounts, the joust plays out over three stages, with each nation’s champion facing off against one opponent. King Irovetti has predetermined who’s jousting whom, but he does not reveal this information until the start of each stage.</p><p>A joust consists of both competitors beginning at opposite ends of the jousting arena. The competitors have 1 round in which they can prepare for the joust (the PCs are allowed to cast spells or otherwise prepare the jousting PC for the event as they wish during this round), after which Nunzio drops the flag and the two jousters charge toward each other, lances lowered, in an attempt to unhorse the other. Both jousters make Nature checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} to determine initiative as they charge toward each other; a character with wild empathy or who can speak to their mount can instead roll Diplomacy to determine initiative if they wish. In the event of a tie, both strike at each other simultaneously, possibly unseating each other in a dramatic clash.</p><p>When a character attempts to unseat a foe during a joust, they attempt an Athletics check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shove} their opponent. On a success, the foe can attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30] save to resist being unseated. On a <strong>critical success</strong>, the foe is automatically unseated. On a <strong>critical failure</strong>, the Shoving character is instead unseated and tumbles to the ground. If the first jouster fails to unseat their foe but remains seated themselves, then the second jouster attempts to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.7blmbDrQFNfdT731]{Shove} the first jouster. If neither jouster is unseated, they replace their lances and shields (both are designed to shatter dramatically when they are used) and line up for another go. Any attack against a foe’s horse is grounds for disqualification.</p><h2><strong>Stage One</strong></h2><p>This stage consists of three separate bouts. In the first, Pitax’s champion Villamor Koth, whom the PCs encountered in the first two events, faces off against a staggeringly drunk human man named Khristel Cotoio from Mivon. As the joust begins, Khristel vomits and topples from his horse, blacking out from the drink. The crowd particularly enjoys this turn of events, although Villamor is frustrated at being denied a chance to show off his skills and sends a tirade of insults at Khristel as his allies drag him from the field.</p><p>In the second bout, the champions from Daggermark and Gralton clash spectacularly, with Chantal Urena (a female human ranger from Daggermark) unseating Sir Briannel Paulson (a male human ranger from Gralton) from his horse.</p><p>In the third and final bout of Stage One, the PC’s chosen jouster faces off against Damanjot, the Tymon champion whom the PCs previously encountered in the archery contest. Damanjot is drunk and waves off all attempts form his supporters to provide aid; his statistics below include calculations for being sickened 2.</p><section class=\"stats\"><aside class=\"porthole right\"><img class=\"scale200\" src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/actor-tokens/npc/damanjot.webp\" /></aside><header class=\"split\"><h3>@UUID[Actor.nqStkMaL5K9R4gsH]{Damanjot}</h3><p>CN male half-orc ranger 11</p></header><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Tymon</li></ul><p><strong>Perception</strong> [[/r 1d20+19 #Perception]]{+19}</p><p><strong>Skills </strong>[[/r 1d20+19 #Athletics]]{Athletics +19}, [[/r 1d20+21 #Nature]]{Nature +21}</p><p><strong>Fort</strong> [[/r 1d20+19 #Fort]]{+19}, <strong>Ref</strong> [[/r 1d20+22 #Ref]]{+22}, <strong>Will</strong> [[/r 1d20+16 #Will]]{+16}</p></section><h2><strong>Stage Two</strong></h2><p>As the reigning champion of the Midnight Joust from the previous year, Villamor Koth sits stage two out and watches impassively as the PCs face off against Chantal Urena of Daggermark (or a clash between Chantal and Damanjot, in the case the PCs’ champion failed to progress from stage one).

He figures that if he can egg his jousting contestant into attacking him, he can kill that PC in self-defense without getting in too much trouble. He does not attempt to unseat a PC contestant when it gets to his turn in the joust, but instead makes a lance Strike against his opponent, following a successful Strike up with a Knockback. This forces the PC to attempt a @Check[type:reflex|dc:30] save to resist being unseated. To the observing crowd, Villamor’s tactics are easily mistaken for overly aggressive attempts to unseat a rider—the crowd certainly loves the violence. If he’s properly unseated by a PC, Villamor swallows his pride for now and nurtures the thought of revenge—he’s one of Irovetti’s closest allies, after all, and knows that the king plans to go to war.</p></section><p>Villamor does not fight to the death at this time. If the PCs respond to his goading by attacking, he’ll “defend” himself (and attempt to kill the attacking PC), but if all the PCs start to gang up on him, or if he’s reduced to fewer than 150 Hit Points, he breaks off his attack and Irovetti steps in to try to calm things down. Villamor resists the urge to Rage during this fight so he can keep his cool and not escalate things too far as a result. If the PCs continue to attack, Irovetti uses magic to escape back to the Royal Pavilion with Villamor and announces that the Rushlight Festival is canceled due to unwarranted aggression on a visitor’s behalf. He gives the PCs an hour to leave Pitax before he attempts to have them arrested as criminals; this development gives him a handy, if flimsy, excuse to go to war with the PCs’ kingdom. Certainly, the PCs aren’t thought of kindly by the other competitors and attendants at the festival, for they see the PCs as the ones responsible for the tournament’s cancellation in this case. See @UUID[.QrjFBXxQxXqklz0L]{Part 2} for more information on how the war develops.</p>"

The PCs receive an invitation from Pitax’s King Irovetti to something called the “Rushlight Tournament.” The invitation arrives via messenger—a fleet-footed man named Velemandr (use the stats for a Pitax warden if necessary) who is willing to wait up to a day for the PCs to make their decision before returning to Pitax to report their response to Irovetti. The invitation is presented as @UUID[JournalEntry.1S5XVzEgRf2MKa6U.JournalEntryPage.rxU60B8rBbVzGdgx]{Handout 8-1}.</p><p>A PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:society|dc:20|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1OagaWtBpVXExToo]{Recall Knowledge} knows that the Rushlight Tournament is one of King Irovetti’s most popular traditions. A Rushlight Tournament has been held every year since King Irovetti claimed the crown; it’s a popular event that draws the majority of its contestants from Pitax but also sees participants from throughout the River Kingdoms. The tournament traditionally takes place on a small area of cleared land on the southern shore of the Rushlight River near the northeastern border of Pitax, just a few days’ travel west of Fort Drelev.</p><p>If the PCs don’t seem interested in attending the Rushlight Tournament, you can have helpful NPCs give some good reasons for taking part in the competition: even if the PCs don’t compete in the numerous events, attending the Tournament is a great opportunity to meet other notables of the River Kingdoms and to present themselves as the rulers of the newest River Kingdom, and failure to appear at this well-known and much anticipated event could be misinterpreted by other River Kings as a sign of weakness or even a deliberate insult or veiled act of aggression. Actually competing in the tournament and winning (or even placing) in the events would bring fame and prestige not only to the PCs, but to their entire kingdom. And finally, there’s the lure of the promised magical wand—this year’s grand prize for the kingdom that scores the most points during the tournament.</p><h3>Alternate Preludes to War</h3><p>This chapter assumes the PCs take up the invitation to participate in the Rushlight Tournament, but Kingmaker is first and foremost a sandbox campaign. Some parties may not be interested in participating in a tournament, and others may well (and rightly) suspect treachery from Irovetti. If the PCs decline the invitation, Irovetti is frustrated yet continues forward with his plans. The events of the Rushlight Tournament take place off-screen (and you can use the rules here later if you wish, with a few names changed, to present a tournament the PCs’ own citizens put on in their honor—in this case, the competition is largely for fun rather than for a vaunted prize, fame, and glory), and the PCs are free to continue to explore the Stolen Lands and build up their resources. Once the PCs reach 14th level, King Irovetti launches an attack on one of their kingdom’s settlements and you can proceed with @UUID[.QrjFBXxQxXqklz0L]{Part 2}.</p>"

One of the Eldest in particular, the Lantern King, used <em>Briar</em> as one of several tools to curse her, whisking the sword away to the Material Plane. This curse makes it impossible for Nyrissa to find <em>Briar</em> as long as it remains quiescent on the Material Plane.

When Nyrissa’s attentions turned to the Stolen Lands years ago, the Lantern King’s agents chose Whiterose Hill as <em>Briar</em>’s new hiding spot, placing it in a subterranean pool below the hill.</p><p>The pool and the hill itself were far from unpopulated. Above, Whiterose Hill had long been the site of an abbey dedicated to Cayden Cailean and built by priests from Galt, while downhill a small winery produced high-quality, small-batch wine and beer. A cave entrance near the winery led deep under the hill to the pool, where a nereid named @UUID[Actor.cPcregujkG0LUHiG]{Evindra} had dwelt long before the priests came to the hill. For many years, Evindra remained hidden from the priests, watching quietly in hiding each time they came to the pool to gather the remarkably pure waters to aid in the production of their beer, but eventually the need for companionship drove Evindra to reveal herself. The priests welcomed her presence, seeing her as a benevolent spirit once she began to teach them the secret of how to enhance the quality of their brewing even further using a combination of primal magic and more precise methods of water filtration. The priests themselves agreed to limit their trips to her home, visiting her only once each year when their grain harvest began.</p><p>When the Lantern King’s agent, a unique shapeshifting fey creature named @UUID[Actor.qLfHY6uNUQ99NZei]{Werendegar} (“Weren” for short), arrived with <em>Briar</em> not so many years ago, he tricked Evindra into believing the weapon was a cursed sword that needed to be hidden from the world. She fell for the smooth-talking fey’s lies, and never told the abbey priests of her new role.</p><p>It all came to an end when a new priest, Barlin Gablivix, arrived at Whiterose Abbey. When his lechery and embarrassing antics caused him to fall out of favor at a temple to Cayden Cailean in Galt (just a year before the Red Revolution would tear that nation apart), the church gave Barlin a choice: excommunication or exile. He chose the latter and was sent to Whiterose Abbey, a place the church assumed would be remote enough that Barlin would have the chance to reflect on his choices while gaining the guidance of the local priests to mend his ways. At first, Barlin’s skill at gardening and cultivating vineyards was seen by the priests as a great boon, but when they finally revealed to the halfling their secret—that their beer production was aided by a fey ally—he became obsessed with Evindra.</p><p>One night, Barlin stole Evindra’s shawl and gained a considerable bargaining chip. He forced Evindra to assume elemental form, and then imprisoned her in a water clock that would prevent her from returning to her true form, so he could keep her to himself. Soon after, the gardener discovered the treasure Evindra had been guarding—an exquisite sword. As soon as Barlin touched the weapon, its suppressed personality stirred, influencing Barlin and amplifying his jealousy and paranoia. It was only a matter of days before <em>Briar</em> drove Barlin to believe that the other priests at the abbey coveted his “bottled bride.” Driven beyond reason, he used Briar to slay everyone else in the Abbey, then retreated into hiding near the subterranean pool. The abbey’s remote location and the fact that those who had financed it in the first place had been slain during Galt’s recent Red Revolution ensured the gardener’s isolation for many years.</p><p>It wasn’t until recently that Irovetti’s agents discovered Whiterose was the site of <em>Briar</em>’s hidden vault. They found the subterranean chamber and the fanatic gardener therein. A battle ensued, but they prevailed—after slaying the gardener, they returned to Pitax with <em>Briar</em> and other treasures Barlin had hoarded, including Evindra’s shawl. They left Evindra herself trapped in her water clock simply because they didn’t find where Barlin had stashed the elegant device away.</p><p>Yet the ill times at Whiterose did not end. Barlin lost his name and his life when he rose as a ghost, finally bringing a bit of truth to the old stories that the place is haunted. This latest development is unknown to Irovetti—he chose Whiterose as a place to spring his trap on the PCs partially because of its remote location and partially because if the PCs succumbed at a supposedly haunted abbey, suspicion would be levied against the supposed ghosts and not himself. To ensure such a fate meets the PCs when they arrive, the king of Pitax sent one of his most dangerous minions—a wererat murderer named @UUID[Actor.SZVTHAwTVXDwIOqC]{Gaetane}—along with a small group of soldiers to set up an ambush. Yet the would-be murderers have found, much to their discomfort, that the rumors of Whiterose being haunted and infested by dangerous vermin are disturbingly accurate, and as a result they’ve had some difficulty in preparing their deadly reception for the PCs.</p><section class=\"skill\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Researching Whiterose Abbey</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>Exploration</li><li>Concentrate</li><li>Secret</li></ul></header><p>Once the PCs hear about Whiterose Abbey or learn of Irovetti’s supposed plot, they may wish to do a bit of research on the site before they visit it.

The priests of the abbey were slaughtered and the site plundered, rumor holds, by bandits, back in 4668 ar.

Rulers rise and fall like the changing of seasons in this tumultuous region, but some of the kingdoms found here have endured and prospered for generations, cementing their place in the pecking order of this confederacy of outlaws. Every new upstart dreams not just of conquest but of legacy, and the wise know full well that the greatest threat to security and legacy typically comes not from established kingdoms but from upstarts fighting for the last seat at the table.</p><p>Pitax is a River Kingdom of some pedigree, able to trace its history back over three centuries. During those centuries, it has been overrun on more than one occasion, first by the Steel Phalanx of Numeria, then a generation later by invaders from Mivon, and it was even split for half a century by civil war between its leading families. Yet through this all, Pitax has remained a hub for trade and a haven for smugglers. But now it faces its most dangerous enemy yet, an enemy from within—its own king, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY]{Castruccio Irovetti}, who may be able to do through corruption and pride what three centuries of war and upheaval could not: bring Pitax to an end.</p><p>Since his flight from Numeria, Castruccio Irovetti has ruled Pitax for over half a decade, and in that time, he has firmly established his hold over this River Kingdom’s political scene through a mix of cunning choice and luck. While he does have the support of the nymph Nyrissa, he hid from her the fact that he’s managed to recover the magical sword she charged him with retrieving, making him loath to call upon her for aid. Furthermore, if he can defeat the PCs, surely that show of strength will bolster his reputation in her eyes, so that he can then present <em>Briar</em> to her for an even greater reward. In Nyrissa, Irovetti sees the only candidate he could imagine taking on as his Queen. See @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx]{Appendix 4} for details on Irovetti’s Numerian items: the @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.p7AccZi8BkUl465M]{mindrender baton} and the @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.8E3PycJpOr8Edoem]{rod of razors}.</p><p>Yet Nyrissa has had little time to wonder why it has taken Irovetti so long to find the sword, for as “War of the River Kings” begins, the time for her to gather up the Stolen Lands draws near. Through her manipulation of Irovetti, she hopes to spur the headstrong king into attacking the PCs’ kingdom. If the PCs don’t react in kind, she is prepared to send one of her agents to provoke them, but she hopes that Irovetti’s unprovoked attack does the trick. She then has but to wait for the human kingdoms that control the lands she wishes to take to weaken each other; she hopes that after the war is over, the surviving kingdom will be worthy of her eldritch assault on the land.</p>"

Today, this tomb serves as a testing ground intended to reveal the God of War’s next champion.</p><p>In the earliest days of the Tiger Lords’ history, the original Armag led his people out of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords and into Numeria. They clashed repeatedly with others, eventually pushing through the Rostland plains to clash against the Iobarian warlords and centaurs of Casmaron. These conflicts hardened Armag, forging him into a legendary champion who earned the direct favor of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.88vRw2ZVPax4hhga]{Gorum}, the Iron Lord and god of war.</p><p>Pride was Armag’s weakness. He boasted he would live forever—that death herself couldn’t slay him. Pharasma heard his boasts and was offended, and her anger manifested as psychopomps aided Armag’s enemies or sought to lay him low on the battlefield. This angered Gorum, who had come to enjoy Armag’s audacity and brutal nature, and as Armag fought against his enemies on the Material Plane, Pharasma and Gorum engaged in a battle of wits in the Great Beyond over the ultimate fate of Armag’s soul. When Armag finally succumbed and died on the field of battle, laid low by a mighty red dragon who served neither deity, Gorum intervened and infused Armag’s soul into his sword Ovinrbaane, preventing his soul from entering the Boneyard. He then sent visions to a Tiger Lord priest named @UUID[Actor.PK8yBANFyMqFZ3IY]{Zorek}, inspiring him to construct a fitting tomb for the Iron Lord’s champion—a tomb that would be sufficiently protected with traps and guardians to test any who might come to claim the legendary sword. Gorum also elevated Zorek into a supernatural guardian to watch over the tomb, charging him with slaying the unworthy and adding their souls to the ranks of those keeping Armag out of Pharasma’s reach.</p><p>Pharasma, in her own inscrutable way, allowed all of this to occur, for it had been Armag’s fate. Still, she brooded for an eon before losing interest, while Gorum eventually moved on to other distractions as well. And so, for several centuries, just as the Tiger Lords themselves became estranged from their own past, Armag’s legacy dwindled into obscurity among the minds of mortals and gods alike.</p><p>This history of Armag’s Tomb is very obscure—success on a @Check[type:religion|dc:35|traits:action:recall-knowledge] check or a DC 30 check in an appropriate Lore skill (such as @Check[type:gorum-lore|dc:30|traits:action:recall-knowledge], @Check[type:pharasma-lore|dc:30|traits:action:recall-knowledge], or @Check[type:warfare-lore|dc:30|traits:action:recall-knowledge]) is needed to recall the legend. Alternatively, a PC who uses @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pkcOby5prOausy1k]{read omens} or similar divination magic in Armag’s Tomb could learn fragments of this history, depending upon what legends they seek.</p><h3>Finding the Tomb</h3><p>Armag’s Tomb and the Tiger Lord camp itself lie in encounter site @UUID[JournalEntry.GRbTr3VTyhezOEhW.JournalEntryPage.7XdF3dBhWlBm7swV]{TL3} in @UUID[JournalEntry.GRbTr3VTyhezOEhW.JournalEntryPage.4j3CCu4criQE1hUO]{zone 12}.

If the PCs don’t recover this important clue, after they’ve liberated Fort Drelev, NPC allies (likely one of the Numestis, but potentially someone like Quintessa or Imeckus, eager to prove their worth to their new rulers) can discover this map and bring the information to the PCs’ attention. Kingmaker assumes that the PCs travel to Armag’s Tomb well before Armag himself emerges, but if the PCs take too long, at your option the Twice-Born Warlord could rise to gather vast armies to his banner, forcing several mass conflicts against the Tiger Lords before the PCs are able to track him down to this location.</p>"

It was for this reason the group was assigned to the dangerous hills known collectively as Glenebon, yet after these four adventurers accept their charter during @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.AeusnG0t5LNtukkD]{Chapter 1}, the PCs hear very little of them, and for a good reason: the Iron Wraiths’ greatest strength was not their skill and power, but their ability to oversell their capabilities. This, combined with the group’s pride, doomed them to failure.</p><p>If the PCs were intrigued by the appearance of the four heavily armored adventurers at the start of this Adventure Path, they may well seek more information about them as the campaign progresses.

Success at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:25|traits:action:gather-information] check to Gather Information confirms that the last known sighting of the Iron Wraiths was as they were heading deep into Tiger Lord territory, seeking to “cut off the head of the beast” by confronting a rising chieftain.

No further news comes forth.</p><p>If the PCs consult with Lady Jamandi about the Iron Wraiths, she can confirm that the adventuring party seems to have gone missing, but she notes that Glenebon is a dangerous place; she hopes the PCs have better luck in their pursuits.</p><p>In truth, at about the time the PCs were dealing with the @UUID[JournalEntry.GciDhpLFRov9s5Fm.JournalEntryPage.hGbNqIbpVUOTqOLi]{Cult of the Bloom}, the Iron Wraiths got in over their heads when they confronted @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.oGZWML8Vdh3pzBJ0]{Armag}. The Tiger Lords captured the four adventurers and held them prisoner for a time. When it came time for Armag to explore the tomb with his honor guard, he used the Iron Wraiths as advance scouts, stripping them of their armor and gear and then marching them into the tomb. All four died as victims to the tomb’s traps and guardians, sacrifices that allowed Armag to more safely reach his goal. Their bodies can be found as the PCs explore the tomb, while their recognizable suits of armor now serve those camped outside the tomb as decor.</p><h2>Who Were the Iron Wraiths?</h2><p>The four adventurers known as the Iron Wraiths all wore distinctive suits of heavy armor with full helms.

The fact that there’s little indication from the baron or his guards that things will be changing soon has many of the town’s citizens on the edge of revolt, but they lack the courage or conviction to rise up—especially in light of the cruelty often displayed by the guards.

He hopes to build his humble workshop into a true luxury store.</p><h3>A3. Ironhand Smithy</h3><p>Kole Jhargee, a mountain of a man, provides for all of Tatzlford’s smithing needs. He and his family are from Brevoy, but he has few kind words to say about his previous home.</p><h3>A4.

According to their prediction, the Twice-Born would be a child formed from the spirit of the original Armag, a warlord who terrorized the northern plains during the Age of Destiny. However, because prophecy had ceased being a trustworthy source of prognostication with the onset of the Age of Lost Omens, the foretelling of Armag the Twice-Born took shape as little more than a wishful curse uttered against the Sisters’ enemies. So when no reborn warlord rose to give flesh and fury to the cult’s prediction, the sisters did not remain idle: they vowed to take an active hand in forcing their prediction to come true and retreated into the Stolen Lands where they abducted a Tiger Lord out on his first hunt. For years, they raised their pawn in the ways of spite and rage and gave him the name Armag.</p><p>The Sisters convinced their pawn that the spirit of the original Armag lay within him, and that they would serve as his guides to aid him in setting his ancestral might free. By advising and strengthening Armag, they planned to guide him to his rightful place among his people, uniting them to fulfill their own prophecy and strike back at Brevoy with an army of nomadic warriors eager to please their reincarnated warlord of old. Armag embraced these goals as his own, aspiring to lead the Tiger Lords. Empowered by the deceptive touch of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.zlJGKpeLBwajP91o]{Gyronna's} faithful, he slew a Tiger Lord boss and assumed the mantle of leadership.</p><p>Then settlers arrived from Brevoy. A group of soldiers and diplomats led by Baron @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.ADMctdyXAlSmymUG]{Hannis Drelev} spread south into Tiger Lord lands along the East Sellen River. These settlers not only established a fort on the shore of Lake Hooktongue, but they also sought out and looted several ancient tombs and burial sites sacred to the Tiger Lords. The final insult came when Drelev’s soldiers tried to establish an unfair alliance with the Tiger Lords. Armag saw through their trickery and ordered his people to attack, but he underestimated his enemy, assuming that “soft diplomats” would not be able to stand in combat. Drelev’s soldiers proved an able match for Armag’s kin and, after three nights of battle, the Tiger Lords fell back. Not only did Armag see his destiny of raiding Brevoy endangered, but suddenly he and his people were on the defensive, losing territory to Drelev’s expansion. However, as Armag fell back deeper into the hills, he found a new ally from an unexpected source: the realm of Pitax.</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY]{King Irovetti}, ruler of Pitax, had already become concerned with Rostland’s expansion into the Stolen Lands, and when he heard rumors that other Brevic agents were expanding south into more distant borderlands and displacing some of the Tiger Lords—a culture Pitax had often clashed with over borders—his paranoid fears saw opportunity. If Irovetti’s forces and the Tiger Lords could work together, they could swiftly defeat these intruders. And if events could be engineered so that the Tiger Lords were at the front of the battle, the bulk of the losses would be from among their troops, further reducing opposition to Pitax’s slow but eventual expansion into the Stolen Lands.</p><p>And so Irovetti and his guards traveled northeast to contact the Tiger Lords and establish a truce. Working together, they descended upon Fort Drelev with a fury and conquered the invaders in a single bloodless wave, for as Hannis Drelev saw the combined forces of Armag’s warriors eager for revenge and Irovetti’s armies readying their siege engines, he made a fateful choice. Always a realist, he saw immediate surrender as the only option to save his life.</p><p>The craven noble sent three riders under a flag of truce to plead with Armag and Irovetti to spare his region, proposing instead to ally with the bandits and to turn control of Fort Drelev to them. His offer to provide information on Rostland and PCs’ kingdom intrigued Irovetti but frustrated Armag, who had hoped for more bloodshed. To force the loyalty—and obeisance—of Drelev’s people, and to help appease the frustrated Tiger Lords, Irovetti accepted Drelev’s surrender, but only on the condition that Drelev’s settlers hand over five of their own as hostages until Drelev himself could prove his loyalty through servitude to Pitax.</p><p>Over the objections of his own men, Drelev did as Irovetti requested, commanding his senior officers to give their eldest sons and daughters to the warlord. However, one captain—a lord-knight named Terrion Numesti—refused. Drelev chose to make an example of Numesti by throwing him in jail and handing his daughter over to the Tiger Lords. Drelev justified this action to his people by assuring everyone it would save their lives and reiterating Armag’s promises that the hostages would eventually be returned unharmed.</p><p>In truth, Drelev cares little for anyone or anything that doesn’t advance his personal agenda. Jealous of the success garnered by the neighboring kingdoms—particularly that of the PCs—he believes his alliance with the Tiger Lords and Pitax will finally give him the means to take over the entire frontier. And with such a large nation under his command, he’ll be able not only to strike back against the Tiger Lords and Pitax, but he will perhaps be able to expand his control into Brevoy itself. In an attempt to sweeten the alliance, Drelev has returned several of the artifacts and treasures he and his soldiers looted from Tiger Lord burial tombs, something that Armag quite appreciated.</p><p>When Armag returned to his people with these artifacts, though, the Sisters recognized them as ancient relics in the style of the nomadic warriors of the original Armag’s time. Correctly assuming the barrow mounds these treasures came from would hold even greater treasures that could legitimize and spread their champion’s influence over his people, the Sisters advised the Twice-Born warlord to claim them as his own. To encourage his choice, they cited legends of how a Kellid shaman laid the original Armag to rest within the same hills along with his famous sword, @UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.DRmaSbUHZnLAZEpl]{Ovinrbaane}, a weapon blessed by Gorum to win any war and triumph in every conflict.</p><p>Now, while Armag is distracted with attempts to delve the tombs of his ancestors and Irovetti has returned to Pitax to prepare for his next audacity—an attempt to lure the PCs out of their kingdom so he can attack their homes in secret (a treachery detailed in full in the next chapter)—Lord Drelev has spent much of his time plotting and brooding. He hopes Armag meets a terrible fate in his people’s tombs, but he isn’t aware that Armag intends to collect the ancient weapon Ovinrbaane—and therefore Gorum’s blessing—and use it to raise his own army. Left unchecked, a mighty champion of war will walk Golarion again, brushing aside all opposition in the River Kingdoms and beyond.</p><aside><h3>Kingdom in the Background</h3><p>With the PC’s defeat of @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK]{Vordakai} and the rescue of Varnhold, that town joins the PCs’ kingdom. With this success, the citizens finally put behind them the fears of the Season of Bloom, and the kingdom enters a growth spurt, expanding south up to the Tors and north beyond the Narlmarches. But as the kingdom grows, rumors and whispers that Pitax is growing nervous about their neighbor begin to spread. When running the troll attack on @UUID[.zW19kGYW1rUZqFST]{Tatzlford}, simply have the mass combat elements play out in the background; focus instead on the PCs’ fight against Ameon Trask and his troll king allies. By the end of the adventure, the kingdom expands north of Hooktongue and talks of annexing Drelev may be afoot.</p></aside>"

The other 16 guards are off duty, relaxing at the Velvet Corner, eating at Bellweather’s, or sleeping on the ground floor of the watchtower.</p><p>The guards are quick to anger; given any excuse, they threaten to “arrest” the PCs—a poor euphemism for “kill and loot;” these guards aren’t interested in capturing the PCs alive unless they recognize who they are, in which case they do attempt to legitimately arrest the PCs so they can present them to the baron.</p><p>Killing all the guards assigned to the town is certainly one way to secure safety in exploring the fort, but too many public battles can panic the populace and thus reduce Liberation Points.

The PCs can earn this XP award up to 4 times, but no more than once every 24 hours.</p></section><h2>Infiltration Tactics</h2><p>The PCs can infiltrate the town and gather information to assess the situation. Perhaps non-intuitively, daytime is the safer time to do so, as the bulk of the soldiers tend to spend more time sleeping during the day so that they can be more active patrolling the city once its curfew begins. As the town’s defenders are more vigilant and numerous during curfew hours—an hour before sunset to an hour after sunrise—the DCs of the skill checks detailed below are increased by 5 during that time.</p><p>The following tactics each afford the PCs a number of hours to explore Fort Drelev. At the end of that time, they’ll need to bring their infiltration to a grinding halt—if they’re moving about in public, they’ll be confronted by 4 Drelev guards within an hour during the day, or within 10 minutes during curfew.</p><p>For all tactics other than Stealth, the fact that the PCs are leaders and heroes of the neighboring kingdom works against them. A character who succeeds at a Deception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.AJstokjdG6iDjVjE]{Impersonate} or otherwise disguise themselves against the guards’ Perception DC avoids this complication. If the guards recognize even one of the PCs as the enemy, they’ll attempt to arrest them, or even attack them if circumstances warrant.</p><p>A fight on the streets against a group of guards not only lowers accumulated @UUID[.kgDuT7kFc11G4NC8]{LP}, but also limits the PCs’ options as word of the violence spreads. After the first fight, guards automatically recognize the PCs—if not as enemy leaders, then certainly as troublemakers—forcing the PCs to adopt stealth or disguises to avoid future confrontations. As a general rule, 4 more guards come to investigate a fight within [[/r 1d12]] minutes of the first fight’s beginning. Potentially, the PCs could defeat all of the guards active in the town, after which point they’ll be able to explore the town freely—albeit at a significant LP cost!</p><h3><strong>Bribery</strong></h3><p>Fort Drelev’s current guards are mostly recruited from mercenaries and ex-bandits, and as such, they can be bribed to look the other way. A bribe worth at least 40 gp purchases the PCs 8 hours of time to explore Fort Drelev, but the guards are greedy and word spreads quickly. With each bribe, the minimum price of the next bribe increases by 20 gp.</p><h3><strong>Deception</strong></h3><p>The PCs can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.ewwCglB7XOPLUz72]{Lie} to the guards to convince them they’re legitimate visitors to the town (perhaps as merchants or traveling mercenaries seeking a place to rest for the night), or to claim that they are in fact citizens of the settlement. The guards haven’t bothered to get to know the townsfolk, so this latter lie is just as likely to succeed as claims of being merchants or mercenaries. Attempting to present themselves as friends of the baron will be met with derision and replies like, “The baron’s got new friends now!”; resulting Deception checks suffer a –2 circumstance penalty. On a successful Deception check, the PCs earn 8 hours of exploration time (or 24 hours on a critical success), while on a critical failure, the guards sense something is off and threaten to arrest the PCs if they don’t immediately leave town.</p><h3><strong>Diplomacy</strong></h3><p>The attitude of Drelev’s guards is initially unfriendly, but the PCs can attempt to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression} on them. If made indifferent, the PCs earn 1d4 hours of exploration time; making the guards friendly earns 8 hours. Making guards helpful via this method isn’t possible, although it can be accomplished with certain types of magic—doing so earns 24 hours of exploration time.

If the PCs reveal who they are to the guards and request an audience with the baron, the guards arrest them, stripping them of weapons, armor, and gear before marching them to Drelev Keep. There, the PCs are taken down to the dungeons and imprisoned in area @UUID[.oHomlg9TVlccbdcP]{C46}, while their gear is put in storage at area @UUID[.dzvKoXUmR8X4UK6m]{C48}. In time, the baron may or may not come to speak to them; it’s more likely he’ll rely upon Imeckus Stroon to perform these interrogations. The baron is interested in the defenses of the PCs’ kingdom and, ultimately, in them surrendering to his rule. He eventually grows bored with interrogations and executes any PCs who are imprisoned rather than risk keeping them around.</p><p>Obviously, the party should resist this fate, whether it’s at the start by attacking the guards or later in a daring prison break.

War encounters are streamlined encounters that resolve mass combats; they are fought by entire armies rather than individual characters. Full rules for building armies, maintaining them, hiring specialized armies, and playing out war encounters appear in @UUID[JournalEntry.TBY1Ir2GtQJqW8VD]{Appendix 3}. This chapter assumes the PCs have not yet started to build up armies, and that they will rely upon defenders already in place at @UUID[.H7wXdZVu3jbnZrIk]{Tatzlford} to handle an attack by a band of trolls and mercenaries, after which the PCs should realize they’ll need to start building up their own kingdom defenses over the following Kingdom turns. The Adventure Path doesn’t confront the party with war encounters again until the next chapter, which should give the PCs plenty of time to build up their military, even if they haven’t begun that process until now.</p><h3>Tatzlford’s Forces</h3><p>The PCs have precious little time to prepare a defense of the town, but if they do, the battle will go much better for them. In the last few days, Tatzlford has managed to scrabble together two relatively small armies to defend itself.</p><p>Statistics for these two armies are presented below; unlike armies recruited by the PCs, these armies do not adjust their level to match the Kingdom’s level. If the PCs wish to keep either or both of these armies on after the Battle for Tatzlford is over, they can automatically recruit them, at which point they adjust their level upwards to match the Kingdom’s level. If the PCs prefer not to take on the additional consumption these two armies bring, the guards and hunters disband and return to their normal jobs after the battle.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header class=\"split\"><p>Journal</p><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.TBY1Ir2GtQJqW8VD]{Appendix 3: Warfare}</p></header><p>The rules for Kingmaker's Warfare subsystem are covered in the attached journal. Note that each army under player control should be given a unique actor, linked to their prototype token. This allows the actor's data to be synced between the Stolen Lands overworld map and the strategic maps that cover individual battles. For enemy armies that you don't anticipate reusing, you can skip this and use unlinked tokens as normal, but if you wish to have a single army reappear several times- for instance, if an army defeats your players' kingdom in battle- you should give them a unique actor with a linked token as well, to differentiate them from other armies.</p><p>Since they are unique armies, the Tatzlford Town Guard and Narlmarch Hunters actors have already been linked.

Without reinforcements, the battle against the army will be tough, but not impossible, and its ultimate success will depend heavily on the success of the PCs’ own simultaneous attack on the army’s leadership. If the PCs traveled with an army or armies of their own, they can add those forces to the battle, but otherwise there may not be enough time to deploy any of their other armies to this location. Normally, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.ysKkyZp02RMujObE]{Deploy Army} activity must be taken during a Kingdom turn, but if you wish, you can allow the PCs to attempt to Deploy Armies that are relatively close to @UUID[.H7wXdZVu3jbnZrIk]{Tatzlford}. On a failure, the army won’t arrive in time (and on a critical failure the army becomes lost as normal for a Deploy Army activity). On a success, if the army had to travel no more than 2 hexes, it arrives at Tatzlford in time to aid in the battle, while on a critical success, an army that had to travel no more than 4 hexes can arrive in time. Regardless, the forced march causes any army deployed in this way to increase its weary condition by 1.</p><p>Thankfully, Kisandra’s warning affords the PCs enough time (barely) to mount a defense of Tatzlford. She can tell the PCs that the attacking group consists of 100 human mercenaries armed with longswords and composite longbows, 50 human Tiger Lords armed with axes, and a dozen immense trolls. The group is commanded by one of Drelev’s right-hand thugs—a pig of a man named @UUID[Actor.QF2AIby1vQRq5b9E]{Ameon Trask}.</p><p>Kisandra can tell the PCs that Ameon’s forces are somewhat disorganized and sloppy—Ameon’s not all that great of a leader and his tactics for the attack are likely to be little more than orders to charge the village en masse while he hangs back with a few guards to observe the clash from afar. The number of trained soldiers and grizzled nomadic warriors he commands more than makes up for these blunt tactics with sheer force; if Tatzlford’s guards were to meet Trask’s forces on even ground, the result would likely be a slaughter. She finishes by pointing out that since Ameon is likely to hang back to observe rather than take part in the battle, a targeted strike on him by the PCs could sway the battle in their favor.</p><h3>Intercepting the Enemy</h3><p>The PCs may decide not to wait for the fight to come to Tatzlford, and instead ride out with their army to intercept (or even ambush) Ameon Trask and his forces on the march. If the PCs have only Tatzlford’s army to attack with, Rezbin is wary as he rightfully points out that the town’s guards would be at a severe disadvantage in an open battlefield; by using the town’s fortifications as defenses, they’ll even up the odds.</p><p>If the PCs insist, Rezbin relents, especially if the PCs have brought their own forces. If the PCs ride out to try to intercept the enemy, have them attempt a @Check[type:exploration|dc:27|roller:party] or @Check[type:wilderness|dc:27|roller:party] Kingdom skill check. On a success, they find the army camped in a large woodland clearing. On a critical success, they gain a +4 circumstance bonus on their initiative checks in the resulting war encounter. On a failure, they don’t find the army and, upon returning to Tatzlford, find Trask’s forces have seized the town; in this event, Trask’s forces gain the defensive advantages of the town, rather than the PCs’ forces.</p><p>If the PCs fight in a forest clearing, the battlefield offers no terrain advantages for either side.</p>",

In her previous life, she was the leader of a group of bandits called the River Razors, a merry band of rangers, druids, and rogues who relied upon their shared talents and skills at bushcraft and primal magic to prey upon aristocrats and rich merchants who used the rivers of Pitax to transport their wealth. After @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.UG1YQsZGkWshc4AY]{King Castruccio} took the crown and banditry increasingly became organized by the Pitax thieves’ guild, Ilora saw her beloved homeland transform into something she hated. Gone were the days when “honest” smugglers and bandits could use Pitax as a safe haven for their work. The rise of drug abuse in the city, the influx of deluded “jesters and fools” eager to please a pompous ruler, and the overwhelming presence of the Pitax wardens turned the city into something she loathed, and her days of banditry turned to rebellion.</p><p>The king and his agents were quick to squash the River Razors, and today, Ilora is the only surviving member. Unable to show her face in Pitax, Ilora continues to build plans to free Pitax from Castruccio and return its rule to the proper families. She’s learned much of the city and knows quite a bit about its defenses, and her reputation as a wanted criminal is likely to come to the PCs’ attention sooner or later.</p><p>If the PCs don’t stumble across her camp on their own during exploration, Ilora eventually learns about them herself. Every few months, she makes the increasingly risky trip downriver to sneak into Pitax under cover of darkness, both to steal supplies she can’t gather in the wild and to listen under open tavern windows to catch up on current events. She hears stories of the PCs’ kingdom and is intrigued from the start, but she doesn’t take action until the @UUID[JournalEntry.yGGSDRma9yTWwdeo]{War of the River Kings} begins. At this point, she casts @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.yhz9fF69uwRhnHix]{animal messenger} to deliver a message to the PCs, inviting them via a short note: “If you wish to discuss how to handle our common enemy, meet me on Hemlock Island at the rise of the next full moon.” (Feel free to replace Hemlock Island with a landmark of your choice.)

She knows the monsters and dangers of the region could slay her swiftly, so she works to maintain a low profile on her hunting or foraging trips. By the time the PCs contact her, she has been living on her own in the wild for years. While her personal hygiene and diplomatic abilities have suffered greatly from her isolation, she maintains a strong sense of self and a natural dignity. Ilora doesn’t need society to thrive, but that doesn’t mean she’s fine with allowing Castruccio to continue to ruin the city she still thinks of as home.</p><p>If the PCs manage to encounter her and befriend her before the War of the River Kings begins, Ilora gratefully accepts any offer of asylum in the PCs’ kingdom; when the war begins, she can provide them advice immediately rather than waiting to arrange a meeting on Hemlock Island.</p><p>Ilora only fights foes she’s confident she can handle in battle.

This is far from a minor accomplishment—not only do the surviving villagers of Varnhold swiftly pledge their loyalty to the PCs and their nation, but the Nomen centaurs are impressed as well and vow to live peacefully with the human settlers in deference to the great work the PCs have accomplished. All the centaurs ask is that they be left the @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq.JournalEntryPage.hQTG4SiKxWOuSfyA]{Nomen Heights} as part of their own territory.</p><p>If the PCs rescued @UUID[Actor.iEB0VtXj6b8IZspz]{Xamanthe} or recovered Skybolt, the Nomen centaurs might have further rewards for the PCs; see the @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.V4svfi888Y8B4uVd]{Rescuing Xamanthe} and @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.QIg81NeQ5dk1EB90]{Skybolt} quests.

Before the vanishing, Varnhold had established a sizable territory of its own, including a road along much of the Kiravoy Bridge and a fair amount of farmland. By rescuing Varnhold’s remaining citizens from captivity in area @UUID[.IE2fAwTiloraWnpy]{F5} and gaining the allegiance of these citizens, the PCs can readily annex Varnhold. If they do, they immediately integrate the town as if they’d achieved a critical success on a Pledge of Fealty activity. Details of Varnhold’s resources and structures appear @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq.JournalEntryPage.qpjnkUuNhEKbwFmX]{here}. Furthermore, all checks on Region activities taken in hexes adjacent to Varnhold have their results improved one degree of success, representing eager help from the rescued citizens. In time, Varnhold will recover from its vanishing, provided the PCs continue to provide for the citizens.</p>",

Finally, he activates <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.uqlxMQQeSGWEVjki]{true seeing}</em> using the @UUID[Actor.eAu4SOvMaNISD3RZ.Item.sSTRFn3C74INZFBX]{Oculus of Abaddon} before entering combat (doing so in the first round of a fight if instead he’s caught by surprise by the PCs).</p><p>Once combat begins, Vordakai starts by casting <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{dominate}</em> on the party’s strongest healer; if successful, he commands the healer to his side to defend him by attacking anyone who attacks the lich in melee. On subsequent rounds, Vordakai uses ranged magic against the party, casting <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.fd31tAHSSGXyOxW6]{vampiric exsanguination}</em> as soon as he’s reduced to 100 Hit Points or fewer.

In addition to the ancient treasures, several magic items Vordakai found on his victims can be found here.

She has a particularly disturbing memory of a nearly skeletal cyclops with a glowing red gem wedged in his otherwise-empty eye socket, who whispered the following to her at some point during her ordeal after she’d been imprisoned here: “You should be honored to be a guest of Vordakai. I shall return once your fear and dread drive all semblance of will and self from your mind, at which point you will thank me for these gifts of pain.” Xamanthe is relatively certain this hateful creature is the one who paralyzed her, but she knows little more apart from the fact that the name the creature used is the same as one long used by her people as that of a sort of ancestral, legendary boogeyman.</p><p>If invited, she readily joins the PCs in helping them explore the tomb, but she knows she may well be out of her depth here.

This island protrudes dramatically from the pool, almost like a stony finger pointing into the sky.</p><p>Though the island is all but forgotten today, ancient texts (such as the ancient geography book by Carmyn e’Brothasa that the PCs may have found in area @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.TJrorq2PkgJ9KeX4]{A12}) refer to it as @UUID[Scene.y5AR9p3bq1Hfp6b4]{Vordakai’s Island}, little suspecting the name refers not to some forgotten explorer but to the cyclops lich that dwells in a tomb carved into the island’s stony heart. Since he was defeated eons ago by kin, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK]{Vordakai} has slumbered in his tomb, unmoving while he awaited the call of his otherworldly masters. He rests unaware that a watch has been set by the centaurs of Iobaria—bitter enemies of his people—to prevent intrusion into his tomb and the subsequent awakening that would surely follow. Even in recent years, when the Nomen watch faltered and humans from surrounding lands managed to penetrate the outer precincts of the tomb, its remote location has continued to ensure that none broke the wards that kept him in his torpor. Not until @UUID[Actor.Tru8p4BbBoIS0hbX]{Willas Gundarson} came from Varnhold and stole a treasure from the tomb, setting off the tomb’s wards, did Vordakai finally awaken.</p><p>Now, the ancient lich studies a strange new world through the eyes of a recently acquired raven familiar and via interrogations of villagers he snatched from Varnhold. As he reacquaints himself with the world and learns that his people’s time has long passed, Vordakai grows increasingly convinced that he has been reborn into a world that is ripe for his rule.</p><h3>Seeking Vordakai’s Tomb</h3><p>The lich Vordakai remains in his tomb, but he’s far from uninformed about the outside world. In particular, his raven familiar, @UUID[JournalEntry.O3T2uvkYQD6kZOEQ.JournalEntryPage.2dVTnEvppzwJgduR]{Horagnamon}, has been scouring the Nomen Heights while Vordakai uses the @UUID[.p9XzCv54ngfPqWMP]{Oculus of Abaddon} to see the world through the bird’s eyes. In this way, Vordakai has learned of the PCs and has been following their movements and progress.</p><h3>@UUID[Scene.y5AR9p3bq1Hfp6b4]{Vordakai's Isle}</h3><p>Vordakai’s tomb lies within a massive, 100-foot-tall, naturally formed stack that rises from the center of a small lake in encounter site @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq.JournalEntryPage.LKXR6bDtNenHkRNu]{LV6}. Its rooms and passageways are all hewn from limestone, often following the natural cracks and seams in the stone, and many bear the linear and pictographic artwork of the ancient cyclops empire embossed in bas relief.</p>"

If the PCs haven’t mentioned @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK]{Vordakai}, she does so now, revealing that the Nomen centaurs believe Vordakai to be a “slumbering warlord—an ancient, powerful figure from the distant past.” Aecora apologizes for being unable to give the PCs more information, as her people have lost much of their history in the years since they were dispersed by Taldor’s armies.</p><p>At this point, Aecora tells the PCs of a place to the west called Olah-Kakanket—the Valley of the Dead. This place is taboo to the Nomen centaurs, but their traditions also dictate that they must watch the valley for signs of disturbance or strange awakenings. Recently, a Nomen hunter saw a frightful shape lumbering amid the stones of Olah-Kakanket. Aecora wonders if, perhaps, the humans of Varnhold with their insatiable curiosity and drive to expand and conquer might have entered Olah-Kakanket and if this, perhaps, might be tied to the vanishing. One thing she can confirm, though, is that the name “Vordakai” is associated with a narrow trail that leads up into the mountains from the far end of Olah-Kakanket; she believes that the valley is a cemetery and that this trail leads to @UUID[JournalEntry.OcO78IbhsDP8cUof.JournalEntryPage.RzHbxYswWo3145mp]{Vordakai’s tomb}.</p><p>If at any time the PCs mention the mysterious bracelet mentioned or sketched in Pendrod’s notes (see area @UUID[.TJrorq2PkgJ9KeX4]{A12}), she says that Nomen centaurs wear no such jewelry, only further convincing her that someone from Varnhold disturbed something that should have been left alone in Olah-Kakanket.</p><p>Before the party departs, Aecora makes one final plea. She admits that the centaur who claimed to see a strange shape lumbering deep in Olah-Kakanket was her headstrong daughter @UUID[Actor.iEB0VtXj6b8IZspz]{Xamanthe}. When Xamanthe confronted Aecora, demanding to learn more about the site, Aecora was unable to satisfy her daughter’s curiosity. Xamanthe has now been missing for several days, and Aecora fears the worst: that her daughter has broken tradition and entered Olah-Kakanket to investigate it on her own. The possibility that her daughter broke this taboo is painful for Aecora to contemplate, but the possibility of the loss of her daughter is more painful. She asks the PCs to remain observant if they enter Olah-Kakanket and to search for clues as to Xamanthe’s whereabouts, if they can.</p><p>Once the meeting with Aecora is over, the centaur politely but firmly asks the PCs to leave their encampment, as their presence makes most of Nomen centaurs uncomfortable and nervous.</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3 class=\"creature-name\">Rescuing Xamanthe</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>30 XP</li></ul></header><article><p>The PCs are tasked with rescuing the centaur Xamanthe from Vordakai’s Tomb.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Aecora Silverfire.</p><p><strong>Completion:</strong> Bring Xamanthe back to the Nomen centaurs, or spin a convincing tale of her fate to Aecora (requiring a critical success at Lying or at Making an Impression).</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> If the mystery of Xamanthe’s disappearance is explained, Aecora thanks the PCs and rewards them with four moderate healing potions and four scrolls of restoration; if the PCs returned Skybolt, she also gives them the bow to honor their service.

Believing the “bracelet” to be an artifact of that culture, he sent word to an old colleague from Oppara—@UUID[Actor.GvcutIrf9nMbjyHv]{Ervil Pendrod}, a scholar specializing in Iobarian antiquities. Maestro Pendrod is also a composer, and as he was in the beginning stages of composing an epic opera dedicated to the history of the Iobarian steppes, he gleefully accepted word of the artifact as evidence of a link between Nomen centaurs and those of ancient Iobaria. He set out for Varnhold to study this magnificent find.</p><p>Yet Maestro Pendrod was not the only individual interested in the “bracelet,” for with its theft, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK]{Vordakai} awoke. Using his powers to recover the ring and discover the location of the thief, the lich located both in Varnhold. Vordakai emerged from his crypt for the first time in thousands of years and made his way toward the village. One still evening soon thereafter, he used a potent artifact known as the @UUID[Actor.eAu4SOvMaNISD3RZ.Item.sSTRFn3C74INZFBX]{Oculus of Abaddon} to create a haunting beckon from a hillock at the edge of town. The magic called forth all of the townsfolk in a daze. By drawing upon ancient reserves of magic, Vordakai captured each villager’s soul and stored them within his crypt as a source of information to educate himself about the new world he finds himself in.</p><h2>The Watcher</h2><p>Vordakai left his familiar, the raven Horagnamon, to spy on Varnhold and the surrounding lands. For several hours a day, Vordakai explores the world by watching through Horagnamon’s eyes. At some point during the adventure, Horagnamon notices the PCs and swoops low to watch, following with interest as Vordakai observes the PCs through the raven’s eyes. Horagnamon is careful to remain more than 100 feet away from the PCs to avoid arousing suspicion, but as the adventure goes on, you should let the PCs know that they have a strange feeling, as if they’re being watched.

Yet other empires existed in these times as well—empires ruled not by humans but by creatures of legend. The cyclopes ruled two such empires, notably one in Garund and another in northwestern Casmaron. As with their contemporaries, time brought an end to their rule.</p><p>Yet while the cyclops empires crumbled, they have not vanished from Golarion altogether. Pockets of them exist today, although they possess but a shadow of their former glory. Only in remote locations does evidence of ancient cyclops empires still exist. One such remnant lies deep in the @UUID[JournalEntry.lMIawppop9uCHRXq.JournalEntryPage.yiEXtaHZrnML6v0K]{Tors of Levenies} in the form of the cyclops lich @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.bLqkRjeESdkEMqkK]{Vordakai}, once a notorious tyrant and powerful necromancer in Casmaron long ago. Vordakai himself did not survive the uprising and turmoil that followed Earthfall during the Age of Darkness, yet ironically his name did. The least of his apprentices appropriated his master’s name in the hope of using its power to rebuild an empire. Yet in the end, this task would require more than notoriety. This new Vordakai became the last when those he was attempting to command rose up against him and, in an ironic turn of events, trapped him in a tomb of his own design, hidden away at the westernmost edge of Casmaron in a minor mountain range often overlooked by explorers and adventurers.</p><p>As the ages wore on and Vordakai’s torpor changed into an ageless slumber, his name lived on in the legends of the region’s Nomen centaurs, who took up a tradition of standing vigil over the approach to his tomb, ready to act upon any sign of his return. But when Taldor’s militaristic expansion into the Stolen Lands drove the Nomen centaurs east into Iobaria, the approach to Vordakai’s tomb was left unguarded. When Nomen refugees returned generations later after Taldor abandoned the Stolen Lands, the tales of Vordakai had largely been forgotten.</p><p>This status quo has remained over the intervening years—until now, that is. When the swordlords of Restov sent agents south into the Stolen Lands, a new colony—Varnhold—was established at the edge of the old centaur rangelands, and along with these settlers came an ambitious treasure hunter named @UUID[Actor.Tru8p4BbBoIS0hbX]{Willas Gundarson}. Using Varnhold as a base of operations and following an ancient map copied from an even more ancient tablet recovered from deep Casmaron, Willas hoped to find a previously undiscovered hoard of treasure. Unfortunately for Willas, he mistranslated the ancient tablet, and what he had assumed was an indication of vast magical wealth was actually a warning of vast magical danger.</p><p>Armed with his mistranslated lore, Willas ranged far and wide while Varnhold was being established, operating under the guise of a scout determining the lay of the land and identifying any potential threats facing the fledgling settlement. It was on one of these journeys that he discovered @UUID[JournalEntry.OcO78IbhsDP8cUof.JournalEntryPage.RzHbxYswWo3145mp]{Vordakai’s Tomb} and crossed the deep waters of the Little Sellen on a swan boat feather token. On the island, he located wards designed to prevent intrusion and grasped something of their dire nature. He was about to turn back when he glimpsed a cache of treasure just a short way down the corridor leading into the tomb. Greed overcame his common sense, and he crept inside to investigate—but as he did, he felt the ancient warding alarms go off. Pausing only to snatch a single jade bracelet, Willas fled the tomb and retreated back across the river.</p><p>Willas knew he’d triggered the guardian wards but managed to creep back out of the ruined complex without triggering any others. He then returned to Varnhold with the bracelet. Along the way, he worked up a story about how he found the jade bracelet on the shore of a riverbank, hoping to cover up his momentary lack of judgment. Unfortunately, Willas’s fears were well founded, for the triggering of the wards woke Vordakai from his ageless slumber, and in so doing, the treasure hunter had doomed Varnhold.</p>"

Among these works is an incomplete ethnography of the indigenous peoples of the Iobarian steppes—Pendrod was working on a section on the Rashalka centaurs and speculated that a local group known as Nomen is an offshoot of the greater Rashalka population who broke away and relocated to this area in the distant past. Mixed in with the books are a number of charcoal sketches of a heavy jade bracelet bearing peculiar markings that Maestro Pendrod has attributed to the premigration Nomen centaurs.</p><p>At the bottom of the stack sits a letter from Maegar Varn dated 2 months ago and addressed to Maestro Pendrod.

For the most part, the Lantern King’s plots and shenanigans tilt toward the cruel, and while he’s long been a master at riding the proverbial razor’s edge between mischief and outright sadism (if only by conserving his cruelest plans for those who invite that cruelty by being cruel themselves, as in the case of Nyrissa), his latest actions have certainly drawn the notice of the other Eldest. As such, they have largely distanced themselves from him, and as a result of this, any defeat the PCs deal to him in this adventure goes not only unpunished by the Lantern King’s demigod siblings but will even be enforced, in a manner of speaking, by the other Eldest so that the Lantern King won’t seek continued revenge against the PCs for their victories. Whether or not this also serves to teach the capricious eldest a lesson to temper his need for mischief with occasional bouts of patience and even mercy, only time can tell.</p><p>The Lantern King’s direct interactions with the PCs in this campaign are via an avatar—a powerful proxy created from himself to rule over the Lantern Kingdom. While this avatar isn’t as powerful as the Lantern King himself, it remains the single most dangerous foe the party faces in Kingmaker. As a demigod, the Lantern King is an even more dangerous foe, equivalent in power to a 29th-level creature and possessing abilities beyond the scope of the core experience in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Some of these abilities, such as the power to manipulate reality, to create powerful artifacts like the Apology, and to build entire demiplane realms like the Hunting Dream or the Lantern Kingdom, manifest during the course of the Kingmaker Adventure Path not as rules content but as story elements the PCs will need to endure—see Chapter 11 of this book for more details.</p><p>In combat, the Lantern King’s avatar uses flight to remain out of melee for the first several rounds of combat, relying upon his spells to soften up the party before using his Strikes against them. He’s fond of taking actions that disrupt, torment, or mock the PCs rather than those specifically tailored to maximize damage. For example, he often uses Playful Switch to swap a flying PC in the air with one who’s on the ground and can’t fly, or he uses illusions to create false foes or locations that play off of previous failures or embarrassments the PCs may have endured during the campaign itself. By playing the Lantern King’s avatar in battle as more of a trickster than a cold-blooded killer, you’ll not only enforce his legendary personality upon your players, but you’ll also give their characters a bit more of a fighting chance against him in battle. He prefers to hold primal phenomenon in reserve to recover from an unwanted condition or situation, and as he realizes the PCs are dangerous foes, he abandons “playful tactics” for more serious or tactical decisions aimed toward defeating the party rather than toying with them.</p><p>While the Lantern King faces no lasting inconvenience if his avatar is slain, the sting of such a defeat is enough to compel the avatar to back down and ask for a truce if the PCs reduce him to fewer than 75 Hit Points. If the PCs agree to a truce, the avatar compliments their prowess and promises to turn his attentions away from the Stolen Lands. Furthermore, he agrees to any additional terms the PCs ask for, provided they are within his ability to grant. This includes restoring Nyrissa’s place and realm to the First World (although he cannot provide further information about her lost lover) and unmaking Briar to restore her capacity to love.</p>",

The lovers inspired each other to increasing acts of audacity, and it wasn’t long before Nyrissa began to think of herself as the newest of the Eldest and proclaimed this to any who would listen, beginning to build her own nation in the First World. Another of the Eldest, the Lantern King, saw opportunity for mayhem here. He spread his influence among his fellow demigods, and before long, several among the Eldest opposed Nyrissa’s claim and took steps to challenge her. First, they sent a jabberwock to destroy her, but Nyrissa defeated it and used its blood to create lesser jabberwocks under her own control. Then they attempted to rally a thousand powerful fey against her, but Nyrissa convinced those fey to serve her instead in return for a place in her domain. Finally, the Eldest exiled Count Ranalc to the Shadow Plane for helping to cause the problem in the first place. Suddenly, Nyrissa found herself without an ally among the Eldest. Having expended much of her energy and resources to defeat the jabberwock and recruit the thousand, she knew that she had lost the war and surrendered, apologizing for her acts.</p><p>The Lantern King decided that Nyrissa’s apology would suffice only for the jabberwock’s death; for her other deeds, he demanded a further punishment—Nyrissa’s capacity to love. Without love, the Lantern King argued to the other Eldest, Nyrissa would not be able to sway another of them to her side. However, if she could replace the “thousand fey breaths” she stole from the First World with a thousand stolen nations, they would accept her apology for her other actions and restore her capacity to love. Faced with no real option, Nyrissa agreed. She was allowed to keep her domain, now known as Thousandbreaths, but it was carved off to form its own demiplane to serve as a sort of prison. Her love was taken from her and transformed into the sword <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.kmzkHnl9Xd62T5mx.JournalEntryPage.vcs1LE9FHFZEQber]{Briar}</em>, which was then entrusted to the Lantern King for safekeeping. He gifted Nyrissa with a chalice he called the Apology, an artifact capable of transforming Material Plane kingdoms she conquered into motes of sand. Once the Apology held a thousand motes of sand, those lands would be absorbed into the First World, Nyrissa would be forgiven, and love would be restored to her.</p><p>The matter settled, the Eldest quickly moved on with their own inscrutable agendas. Yet while they eventually forget about what they’d done to Nyrissa, the nymph herself did not. She grew more and more obsessed with her loss of love—or perhaps it was the loss of love that caused her to grow more violent and obsessed. In her early attempts to discover the location of <em>Briar</em>, she received the visions that would come to haunt her—that <em>Briar</em> would be returned to her, but only as an instrument of her own death.</p><p>Now she has but one kingdom left to claim: the new kingdom risen in the Stolen Lands. With the War of the River Kings over and one kingdom a victor, the time is right for the final grain to be added to the Apology. That this will destroy a significant region on Golarion is irrelevant to the loveless nymph; in her obsession, she fails to see that this act may be the very thing that drives her enemies from to slay her as in the vision.</p>",

The bastard son of a crusading Taldan knight and a Numerian noblewoman, Castruccio’s birth name was the even more flamboyant Mandalarucio. His father sent regular deliveries of gold from the field of battle, so he and his mother Cimany never wanted for wealth. Mandalarucio’s mother doted on him, paying for dance, music, and language lessons and parading him among the other nobles of Hajoth Hakados as often as possible. Mother and son knew little of hardship until the payments from Mandalarucio’s father—a man the future king never met—ceased with the elder’s death at the hands of the Worldwound’s demonic host. Cimany did her best to make ends meet, but she and her child had both grown used to extravagances, and within two months their funds had given out. The cutthroat aristocracy of Hajoth Hakados swiftly took action to reclaim the family estate, and just like that the two were out on the street.</p><p>After suffering another two months of indignities, Mandalarucio turned to crime, using occult magic to gain the confidence of rich visitors and then robbing them, leaving behind victims too shamed at being duped to pursue justice. Eventually, though, Mandalarucio made a critical error by attempting to con and rob a member of the Technic League. When the con went sour and the Technic League sorcerer lost his hand to Mandalarucio’s blade, the budding con artist went into hiding to escape punishment. But the Technic League didn’t need him to repay the blood debt—operating under the aegis of the Black Sovereign and the slanderous whispers of local aristocrats, they quickly found that the missing man had a mother. They arrested Cimany, and by the time Mandalarucio heard of her arrest, she’d already been executed.</p><p>When he learned of this development, Mandalarucio wasted no time. He stole into the inn the Technic League agents were staying at and extracted his revenge in a single night of red ruin. When the sun rose, the five Technic League agents were dead and the delivery of rare Numerian artifacts they had been entrusted with delivering to Starfall had vanished. Hajoth Hakados’s government had its suspicions, but the case was never solved, for Mandalarucio had fled Numeria entirely, never to return.</p><p>The next two years of his life were spent lying low in the River Kingdoms. He changed his name to Castruccio Irovetti, combining the first and last names of his mother’s favorite artists. He periodically sold off some of the Numerian artifacts he’d stolen for funds, but overall, he kept a low profile. It wasn’t until his wanderings took him to Pitax that his fortunes finally changed. After hearing rumors of strange treasures hidden in the forest called Thousand Voices, Irovetti entered the mysterious woodland in search of riches. It may have been his good looks and strong singing voice that attracted the attention of the cruel queen of Thousand Voices, but more likely it was the intrusive stink of the technological items he carried that caused the nymph Nyrissa to take special note of this latest intruder. She sent her minions against Irovetti to test him, but he defeated them all with a combination of his magic, his wits, and his Numerian devices.</p><p>Intrigued, Nyrissa realized that here was a perfect tool to use to increase her influence over the encroaching tide of civilization. She appeared before Irovetti, who in the face of such power had little choice but to fall to his knees in adoration. Nyrissa took Irovetti away for a month to her strange and wondrous realm in the First World. There she showed him great marvels and fearsome sights, and on the eve she returned him to Pitax, she granted him her favor and became his muse, giving him a lock of her hair. In return, she asked only that he perform one favor for her in the world of mortals—recovering a sword called Briar, lost long ago somewhere in the region. (For more information on how Nyrissa lost Briar, what the sword actually means to her, and why she can’t simply retrieve it on her own, see @UUID[JournalEntry.geHtEMsUzqsld8cx]{Chapter 10}.)</p><p>With Nyrissa’s favor granting Irovetti even greater skill, he made his way to the city of Pitax. He reasoned that with a kingdom at his command, the search for a missing sword would be a trivial thing. Armed with his two remaining Numerian devices and an idea of how to become Pitax’s newest ruler, Irovetti wasted no time setting his plot into motion. One of his Numerian devices is a mindrender baton—a technological wonder capable of commanding false loyalty in a victim’s mind. Irovetti began building his reputation in the city by using the mindrender baton to aid in purchasing several warehouses for scandalously low prices and securing relationships and deals with several important merchants and smugglers. Eventually, he invited two of Pitax’s leaders, the brothers Lothaire and Berengar, to a card game at one of his warehouses. Through the use of his mindrender baton and magic (particularly modify memory), Irovetti swindled the brothers out of their rule; the next morning, neither had any memories of being duped, but Irovetti owned a signed document legally handing over all the possessions of the ruling family to him, including the crown of Pitax.</p><p>At first, Irovetti used his new resources as king of Pitax to search for Briar. But as the years wore on, his memories of his time with Nyrissa began to pale against the reality of the decadence and power that ruling a River Kingdom brought. While her influence continued to subtly manipulate Irovetti’s personality (and is in large part responsible for his founding of Pitax’s Academy of Grand Arts), her hold over his heart and lusts faded. So when several of Irovetti’s agents came to him years later with the good news that Briar had been found, Irovetti did something his fey patron hadn’t foreseen: he had his agents murdered before they could spread the news, then hid Briar away in a chamber deep under his palace. Irovetti feared that upon returning the sword to Nyrissa, she would cast him aside. He was not yet ready to lose the power her favor granted him, and he reasoned that he could simply rule Pitax for another decade or so and keep Briar’s recovery secret; then, when he grew tired of life as a king, he could announce to Nyrissa his “recent recovery” of Briar and enjoy the reward for his service to the fey queen.</p>",

More and more of the townsfolk gather to hear him talk and, as the days wear on, he builds a wellspring of support among the disaffected settlers in the town. Every decision the PCs make has a winner and a loser, and Grigori is gifted at shifting focus to the losers in these decisions and riling them up. Whether it is appealing to the citizens who didn’t get what they wanted when the PCs built a new city block, to spinning a narrative that paints a recent event in the most horrid light for those for whom the outcome was a negative, a properly played Grigori should become a constant barb in the players’ side and one of the most memorable villains they encounter. Grigori takes great pains to avoid breaking any of the PCs’ laws so that they have no legal justification to arrest him other than that they want to silence him.</p><p>Grigori is more than just an itinerant storyteller; he’s a spy and agent provocateur sent by King Irovetti, the Lord of Pitax, to spread chaos and dissent in the town with the aim of overthrowing the PCs and possibly paving the way for Pitax to annex the settlement. In order to cover his tracks and retain plausible deniability, Irovetti used several layers of agents to hire Grigori; as far as the bard knows, he was hired to cause trouble in this fledgling town by agents from Fort Drelev to the west.</p>",

That the king wasn’t very supportive of art styles and pursuits he didn’t enjoy never even registered in Tartuccio’s mind, as his tastes were so similar.</p><p>And so Tartuccio set into motion plans to catch the king’s attention, so as to become first his student, then his trusted advisor, and in time his replacement. He even went as far as to seek out, research, and learn a potent magical technique that allowed him to change shape, intending to use this newfound supernatural power to adjust his appearance to be something more pleasing to the king’s eye when the time came to petition to become his student.

When this cyclops tyrant was defeated during the chaos following Earthfall, one of his apprentices claimed his name as well as his greatest treasure, the Oculus of Abaddon. Though he had been the least of the necromancer’s apprentices, the new Vordakai was nevertheless a powerful wizard, but it would take more than power to claim the true Vordakai’s mantle. Betrayed by followers of the original leader who refused to serve him, the new Vordakai was sealed into his own tomb, and over the passage of eons, the cyclops lich atrophied.</p><p>Although much weakened today, Vordakai remains a dangerous opponent who can devastate a poorly prepared party on his own. Don’t be afraid to play Vordakai as arrogant creature—he has existed for longer than most creatures on Golarion, after all, and if he makes arrogant mistakes (such as neglecting to cast spells defensively or provoking Attacks of Opportunity), that not only gives the PCs a chance to survive but also helps to establish the ancient lich as both overconfident and a bit careless from his long period of quiescence. Keep in mind that Vordakai is the most powerful foe the PCs have encountered in the Kingmaker Adventure Path thus far, and in defeating him, they will accomplish something truly legendary.</p><p>The greatest diminishment of Vordakai’s power is represented through the loss of his soul cage—the magical item he initially used to trap his own soul and enable his transformation into a lich in the first place. He cannot create a replacement as long as he remains atrophied, but his arrogance works against him here. Only if he’s reduced below 20 Hit Points does he realize that the PCs have a very good chance to defeat him, and if he survives long enough to take a turn after this realization, he casts his 5th-level dimension door to flee to area C5 of his tomb. If he’s able to escape in this way, he’ll wait for a few days before returning to his tomb, infuriated if the PCs have released his prisoners and robbed him blind. At this point, Vordakai can become a recurring villain in your campaign!</p><p>In Vordakai’s case, he has forgotten much arcane lore and lost a significant amount of his spellcasting ability. At the height of his power, he was a 20th-level wizard, but today, his power has reduced to that of a 12th-level wizard. More troubling to the lich is the fact that he can no longer use a soul cage to rejuvenate—if Vordakai is destroyed, he crumbles to dust, forever dead. Given time, Vordakai could recover his power and regain his rejuvenation ability, but it’s unlikely the PCs will give him that chance, as it would take the lich several years to undo the ravages of centuries.</p><h3>Eclipsed Incantations</h3><p>Vordakai keeps his spells in a massive ironbound tome called Eclipsed Incantations (Bulk 3). His known spells once spanned several books, but today, Eclipsed Incantations is the only survivor. It contains all of the spells Vordakai currently has prepared, along with the following 12 additional spells: <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.bay4AfSu2iIozNNW]{banishment}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.GUeRTriJkMlMlVrk]{bind undead}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE]{clairvoyance}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.LiGbewa9pO0yjbsY]{confusion}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.0jadeyQIItIuRgeH]{eclipse burst}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.K2WpC3FFoHrqX9Q5]{hypnotic pattern}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.6Ot4N22t5tPD51BO]{knock}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Azoh0BSoCASrA1lr]{lock}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Uqj344bezBq3ESdq]{nightmare}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.kWh8sJH7yawidMyW]{shrink item}</em>, <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.xqmHD8JIjak15lRk]{unseen servant}</em>, and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.MZGkMsPBztFN0pUO]{water breathing}</em>.</p><p>Eclipsed Incantations includes the rituals <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.c3b6LdLlQDPngNIb]{create undead}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.2ykmAVKrsAWcazcC]{planar binding}</em> (both of which Vordakai can still perform), and also <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.2CNqkt2s2IYkVnv6]{imprisonment}</em>. The latter ritual takes up the bulk of the book’s second half, and since it’s an 8th-level ritual, the cyclops lich has lost the ability to perform it due to his atrophied state.</p><p>Feel free to add any additional spells or rituals to this spellbook as you desire in order to provide specific rewards for the PCs.</p>"

Additionally, the notes can point the PCs toward any undiscovered points of interest in the Stolen Lands if you wish, as Irovetti’s scouts have been exploring and reporting on the area for years.</p><p>Of particular interest among these notes are those found in a slim, red leather folio. These notes, written in Aklo, document numerous points of research into “places of power” hidden within the Stolen Lands. A PC who takes an hour to research these notes discovers that Irovetti has been sending scouts and explorers out to investigate areas within the region where he suspects potent magic might be recovered to aid him in his fight against the PCs’ kingdom. You should tailor these locations to make it appear that Irovetti’s growing increasingly frustrated as sites he explores end up either disappointing them or are places the PCs have already explored during the campaign, but one site in particular should catch the PCs’ attention—the island of @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.FCJOgl9jjFQ02ecR]{Candlemere}.</p><p>Irovetti’s notes on Candlemere focus on initial reports that cite old rumors of a great treasure or a great danger—or perhaps both—having been sealed into a vault below a magical seal placed centuries ago by the priesthood of Pharasma. The reports from his field agents speak of encountering large numbers of will-o’-wisps on Candlemere, of an oppressive magical aura, and of an intriguing spiral seal found in an underground chamber below.

While the Cattaneis themselves wanted no part of this deal, they were forced to accept it lest they succumb to complete financial ruin. Today, the Trade House functions primarily as a base of operations for Xapiri’s studies into sorcery as she seeks proof of her theory that infernal influences on a person’s blood make them more suited to leadership, and that hellspawn tieflings should be idolized and encouraged rather than vilified as examples of weakness by House Thrune. She has been using the Trade House’s revenue to fund these investigations and experiments, with the needs of the Cattaneis often being set aside, marginalized, or entirely ignored. What Xapiri has told no one is that she didn’t leave Cheliax voluntarily but was forced to flee when House Thrune caught wind of her research.</p><p>Though the Cattanei family had the greatest role in founding Pitax, its influence in the city diminished with each passing year. The actions of the traitor Ludov Cattanei a hundred years ago weakened their reputation, and the civil war that followed shortly thereafter nearly destroyed them.

                            "text": "<p>Irovetti’s palace is one of the oldest buildings in the city, built by an eccentric wizard who had a strange fascination with doors, twisting mazes, and architectural whimsies. The baffling structure fits Irovetti’s needs well, and the tangle of halls and doors makes it an easy place to get lost in and an even easier place for its denizens to defend. The palace certainly earns its nickname—the “House of a Hundred Doors.” In fact, the palace has well over a hundred doors, many of them secret.</p><p><strong>Approaching the Palace</strong>: If the PCs haven’t accumulated at least 30 @UUID[.EiiVa70gDJOJ8N74]{Liberation Points}, any approach to the Palace is potentially observed by the guards. Pitax Wardens are posted at the six watchtowers in the palace (see below), and during the day they’ll automatically notice the PCs approaching and raise the alarm unless they disguise themselves or use magic to provide some sort of cover (but if the magic is obvious, such as a sudden fog bank rolling in, the Wardens still notice it and raise the alarm). At night, the PCs can attempt a @Check[type:stealth|dc:32|traits:action:avoid-notice] check to approach the Palace undetected. If the alarm is raised, patrols within the Palace quickly move to ballista chambers to fire upon the PCs (see area @UUID[.4SoUzhH0XGCGMBN8]{C7} for details). If the PCs are at or above 30 Liberation Points, the guards have largely fled the Palace and the PCs can approach safely without needing to use Stealth.</p><p><strong>Walls</strong>: Despite the expansive size of the house, the palace has only one floor above ground. Its roofline is a complex tangle of slopes, domes, and pitches that barely seems to match the underlying layout of rooms and halls. The external walls and roof are comprised of two 1-foot-thick stone walls sandwiching two 3-inch-thick iron walls, which themselves sandwich a thin layer of lead sheeting—all of which has been enhanced to resist magical effects that target the walls themselves. The walls attempt to counteract any spell that targets them as a result (7th level, counteract +22). The exterior walls (Hardness 18, HP 70 [BT 35]) can be Climbed with a @Check[type:athletics|dc:30|traits:action:climb] check. The interior walls (Hardness 14, HP 56 [BT 28]) are of similar construction but half the width.</p><p><strong>Watchtowers</strong>: Most of the spiral stairs in the palace (with the notable exception of the flights found in areas @UUID[.F8t435Vd9XvitFQQ]{C15} and @UUID[.cZd4hZ5hZQnkoJiD]{C16}) lead up to small watchtowers on the palace roof above. As long as the PCs haven’t reached 30 Liberation Points, these rooftop watchtowers are each occupied by a Pitax Warden ready to raise the alarm if they see anyone attempting to enter the palace from above. Each rooftop watchtower is accessed via a trapdoor that can be locked and bolted. Opening a trapdoor requires three @Check[type:thievery|dc:34|traits:action:pick-a-lock] checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]{Pick a Lock} or a @Check[type:athletics|dc:36|traits:action:force-open] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SjmKHgI7a5Z9JzBx]{Force Open}—each door has its own unique key held by its accompanying guard. If the PCs have achieved 30 or more Liberation Points, the Wardens have abandoned their posts but left the doors locked.</p><p><strong>Other Palace Features</strong>: Most hallways and chambers in the palace have 18-foot ceilings, but several areas have even higher ceilings; these variations are mentioned in the text. Light inside the palace is provided by everburning torches in the grand hall and by common oil lamps elsewhere. In addition, most rooms possess slit windows or slitted skylights. These windows, rarely more than 1 foot wide, are of leaded crystal in narrow diamond-shaped panes between 1-inch-thick leaded steel bars (Hardness 20, HP 50, [BT 25]). The fireplace chimneys in the Great Hall and kitchens are blocked by similar grates without the glass. Unless otherwise noted, secret doors in the palace can be discovered with a successful @Check[type:perception|dc:30|traits:action:search] check.</p><p><strong>Raised Alarms</strong>: Those infiltrating Irovetti’s palace must be very careful if they wish to avoid a general alarm. Once the alarm is raised, word spreads throughout the palace rapidly, and the alarm stays raised for 24 hours. In addition to the various guards listed at key locations, there are six roving bands of guards, each consisting of four Pitax Wardens. If the alarm is raised, two of these groups mobilize and move to investigate the source of the alarm, arriving in the area after [[/r 2d6]] rounds. In addition, as long as the alarm is raised, all of the palace’s defenders and inhabitants gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks.</p><p>If the PCs have achieved 30 Liberation Points, these six bands of guards have abandoned the palace, and a raised alarm only bolsters the Perception of those who remain behind in keyed areas.</p><h3>Unkeyed Rooms</h3><p>The majority of the rooms in Irovetti’s palace aren’t labeled on the map. These unkeyed rooms consist of two types: the 5-foot square rooms are privies containing a single toilet, and the 5-by-10-foot rooms are bedrooms for guards, servants, or guests (although Irovetti has currently dismissed all of his servants and his only guest—the weretiger Alasen—has her own larger room). Each of these unremarkable rooms contains a single bed, a nightstand, and a footlocker. The doors of these rooms can be latched from within but not locked. Unlatching a door from the other side requires a @Check[type:thievery|dc:25|traits:action:pick-a-lock] check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2EE4aF4SZpYf0R6H]{Pick the Lock}.</p><p>Some of these unkeyed rooms have been trapped by the guards in an attempt to slowly erode the resources of any intruders into the palace. Each time the PCs enter an unkeyed room, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:8] (or a @Check[type:flat|dc:16] if the PCs have achieved at least 30 Liberation Points). On a <strong>success</strong>, the room contains either a @UUID[Actor.KpBLGfDHPV71wj7e]{clockwork crossbow} (treat as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.mWXaROc9ytjdGVVP]{scything blade} snare that inflicts piercing damage) or a @UUID[Actor.o3zdn7YGpTuUfo0a]{flash bang} (treat as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.a2XaerM1KkPyLIPM]{stunning snare} that raises the alarm if it’s triggered), with an equal chance of either.

The violence between Pitax and Corvenn culminated in an incident known as the Deafening Flames, when rebels from Corvenn torched the southern wall of Pitax and razed the southern half of the city. Though Corvenn and Pitax eventually resolved their differences and merged back into a single River Kingdom, the damage was done. The southern half of Pitax lay in ruin for decades, just a pile of rubble and lingering ashes.</p><p>Recent additions to the entire city can be found in the form of statues, particularly gargoyles. Commissioned by Irovetti himself to mimic the historic pomp of aged southern cities, most of these statues are disgusting or crude works of monsters or human figures—sometimes both. Many of the gargoyles that sit ominously atop rooftops in Pitax—especially those closest to the palace where Irovetti resides—are works of genuine quality, but over the past few years, more sloppy and crude efforts have spread across Pitax like a disease.</p><p>The wharfside of <strong>Troutmouth</strong> is a strange mix of hardworking warehouse workers living with their families and freebooting sailors who drift in and out of the city with their ships. Though this often leads to loud and boisterous conflicts between the two groups in the wee hours of the morning, both the workers and the sailors share a grudging respect for one another. The two groups are unified by a shared loathing for the Bandit Houses, which they believe to be rich, selfish, and indifferent to their problems. Wooden warehouses standing amid smaller wooden buildings line the docks of Troutmouth. Of these smaller buildings, most are old and weatherworn, with even the newer buildings bearing obvious water damage from the Pitax River’s occasional floods. Muddy roads crisscross their way through Troutmouth, but these slowly give way to cobblestone streets as they finally enter the Shattered Ward and the heart of Pitax.</p><p>Long the spiritual heart of Pitax, the <strong>Shattered Ward</strong> grew from the remnants of the bandit keep built during the city’s earliest days. This is where most merchants and travelers conduct their business. Its streets are the busiest, its buildings the largest, and its shadows the most likely to hide secrets and dangers. Large buildings made of dark limestone, some several stories in height, rise throughout this area, surrounding the Common Square like stones ringing a campfire. A large wall known as the Inner Fortress, made from limestone of a lighter hue, runs along the southern border of the Shattered Ward.</p><p>Old and new gates alike lead from that wall into the <strong>New Ruins</strong>, the part of Pitax that was once overrun and destroyed during the city’s bloody civil war a century earlier. New stone roads and small stone buildings, built from the remains of the great towers that once stood proudly over the city in earlier days, stand amid the genuine ruins in this partially rebuilt sector. When Irovetti ascended to power, he proceeded to take ownership of this area that had long lain fallow, and he began rebuilding it according to his own garish tastes. The Red Crescent Theater and the Academy of Grand Arts became the heart of the revitalized west end of Pitax. Though both were built ostensibly for the purpose of making Pitax a haven for fine art, Irovetti had a shrewder purpose in mind: attracting builders, artists, and merchants, and, by extension, more money. The New Ruins now presents a half-realized appearance, with the sculpted stone facades of buildings along the Inner Fortress turning to carved wood and eventually to plain timber near the edge of town. At its farthest reaches, public funding and interest waned, leaving several blocks of aging rubble and dangerous, burnt-out frames available for whatever squatters or dangerous creatures dare to claim them.</p><section class=\"encounter\"><header class=\"split\"><h3>Warden Patrols</h3><p>Low 14</p></header><p>Trios of Pitax Wardens patrol the city streets, and they confront the PCs if they notice them. Generally, such a confrontation occurs only when the PCs fail or critically fail at certain Liberation activities, but at your option (such as if the PCs make an extremely public appearance), they are confronted by a Warden patrol that attacks them at once. If characters wish to escape the Warden patrol, you can have them attempt an Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, or Stealth check against the Pitax Wardens’ Reflex DC to see if they can get away, with a failure resulting in a fight. Once an encounter with a Warden patrol finishes, if the PCs don’t use their next Exploration activity to Lie Low, they lose 1d4+2 Liberation Points as a result of increased patrols spreading fear through the populace.</p></section><h3>City Walls</h3><p>Pitax’s stone city walls are strong and sturdy, oft repaired and enhanced—particularly over the past year as Irovetti has had increasing convictions that his city should be more fortified. The walls themselves offer few handholds—it’s a @Check[type:athletics|dc:30|traits:action:climb] check to Climb them—but their primary purpose is to provide numerous points of fortification for a wide range of ballistae, catapults, and other siege engines. The king makes sure to keep these well-attended, ensuring that any attempt to take Pitax by force will pay dearly for the attempt.</p>",

Before Irovetti’s arrival, eight factions held different degrees of influence over the city. Some of them supported Pitax’s rulers while others opposed them, and this hasn’t changed with the new rule, although the factions tread carefully in how they interact with Irovetti—he has already proven to some of them that he has the temperament and the power to break them if they cross him.</p><p>Each of these eight factions traditionally identifies itself with specific colors, symbols, and types of clothing.</p><table><caption>Factions of Pitax</caption><thead><tr><th>Faction</th><th>Type</th><th>Color</th><th>Symbol</th><th>Clothing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Calistrians</td><td>Faith</td><td>Black, yellow</td><td>Three daggers</td><td>Religious raiment</td></tr><tr><td>Cattanei Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Green</td><td>Coiled snake</td><td>Black vest with green thread</td></tr><tr><td>Dealers of Pitax</td><td>Criminals</td><td>Gray</td><td>Two X marks</td><td>Long coat with hidden pouches</td></tr><tr><td>Desnans</td><td>Faith</td><td>Blue, white</td><td>Butterfly</td><td>Religious raiment</td></tr><tr><td>Liacenza Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Dark red</td><td>Fox’s head</td><td>Left glove with a dark red mark</td></tr><tr><td>Red Crescent Troupe</td><td>Entertainers</td><td>Red, black</td><td>Crescent</td><td>Gaudy, blue and purple outfits</td></tr><tr><td>Strocalle Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Purple</td><td>Cracked coin</td><td>Long sash attached to belt</td></tr><tr><td>Vascari Family</td><td>Bandit House</td><td>Light blue</td><td>Blue heron</td><td>Blue tabard with large collar</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Bandit Houses</h3><p>Long ago, a group of bandits fleeing reprisal in Brevoy founded the safehold that would become Pitax. Their leader became the patriarch of the <strong>Cattanei</strong> family, esteemed residents who ruled over Pitax during the early centuries of its existence. Descendants of the other original bandits also formed three other influential families: the <strong>Liacenzas</strong>, the <strong>Vascaris</strong>, and the <strong>Strocalles</strong>. And while today these four families operate more as merchant cartels than criminals, tradition has kept their label as the Bandit Houses of Pitax. Today, three of the four Bandit Houses own and control their own warehouses, which serve as their means of conducting business. The fourth family, the Liacenzas, recently lost control of their Trade House to Irovetti, but for the time being, they retain enough influence in town to remain an important faction.</p><h3>Dealers of Pitax</h3><p>The main rival to the Bandit Houses is a loose coalition of despicable merchants, drug dealers, and criminals who seek to win fortune for themselves at the expense of Pitax’s honest traders. Pitax’s criminal underground wields formidable influence in the city, and with the arrival of Irovetti, their power—and ambition—grows daily. These criminals are referred to collectively as the <strong>Dealers of Pitax</strong>, and increasingly, a gnome man named Kharne Vereel serves as the one they look to for leadership. Kharne and his favored agents can be found at the Rose Tower (see area @UUID[.0EPrUfA3F2lGsRMl]{B6}).</p><h3>Pitax’s Churches</h3><p>While Pitax itself isn’t a particularly religious city, two churches in particular have widespread favor. The <strong>church of Calistria</strong> (see area @UUID[.StHWCPlKnLVgdItW]{B13}) is the more powerful, as it represents the oldest religious tradition in the area. The <strong>church of Desna</strong> (see area @UUID[.czIYU0reyL4kAEby]{B8}) is relatively new, having arrived in Pitax only a year before Irovetti himself. Neither church is particularly fond of Irovetti, but each has their reasons for not taking a harder stance against him. One would perhaps expect a temple of Shelyn in a town purportedly devoted to the arts, but the city’s general attitude ironically makes it an unwelcoming place for this faith.</p><h3>The Red Crescent Troupe</h3><p>The newest notable faction in Pitax are the actors, directors, and playwrights of the <strong>Red Crescent Troupe</strong>. Irovetti won them over by financing a theater named after them, and as such the performers have felt indebted to him from the start. In the early years of Irovetti’s rule, the Red Crescent was among the city’s largest draws, but the troupe is now on the edge of an internal schism as those who look to rebel against Irovetti clash against those who fear losing everything they’ve built up over the years. This faction is based in the Red Crescent Theater (area @UUID[.IWafhPrsUGqxvrh4]{B17})</p>",

Her weekly shipments to the palace to deliver fresh wares to Irovetti have afforded her a fair amount of goodwill from the king, but what few (particularly Irovetti himself) ever see, however, is Ingras’s loathing for the Pitax Wardens, who callously slaughtered her son for some arbitrary affront a few years ago.

At the same time, clandestine infiltrations into Pitax to destabilize his support from within can strike a devastating blow to Irovetti’s plans. Through a combination of defeating his field armies and turning factions within the city against him, the PCs can break the morale of the Pitaxian army and force King Irovetti to retreat into his palace, whereupon he’ll be cornered. These allies point to Irovetti’s legendary stubbornness as another great disadvantage, for he won’t consider fleeing “his” kingdom as long as the chance to defeat the PCs exists.</p><h2>Liberation Activities</h2><p>Pitax is a nation united under a competent and canny leader.

They can pursue this goal using Liberation activities. Doing so awards Liberation Points (or penalizes them in the case of failures). Liberation Points can also be gained or (more often) lost through other developments, as summarized in Liberation Point Adjustments below.</p><p>Liberation activities play out in Exploration mode.

A PC can certainly discover a location’s liberation activities by stumbling on the location and asking the right questions, but it’s perhaps more efficient for a PC to use the Seek Opportunity activity instead to learn about these specific opportunities.</p><p><strong>Initial Liberation Points</strong>: If the PCs won the Rushlight Tournament, their fame precedes them and they begin with 6 Liberation Points. If they made second place, they start with 3 Liberation Points. Otherwise, they start with 1 Liberation Point. Add 2 Liberation points for each battle the PCs have won against any of Pitax’s field armies, and subtract 2 for each such battle lost.</p><p><strong>30+ Liberation Points</strong>: Once the PCs accumulate at least 30 Liberation Points, the atmosphere on Pitax’s streets grows very decidedly anti-Irovetti. As long as the PCs’ Liberation Point total remains at 30 or higher, no Warden patrols are encountered on the streets of Pitax, and the number of guards and defenses present at the palace is reduced as detailed in Part 5.

However, although no expense was spared to construct several new buildings for the academy, Irovetti proved notoriously cheap when it came to attracting skilled teachers of the various arts. Unable to tell the difference between good art and bad, and generally preferring bad anyway, Irovetti recruited a faculty of failed artists, has-beens, and never-weres, most deluded into believing themselves unrecognized geniuses rather than mere hacks. Bad teachers begat bad students, so combined with Irovetti’s heavy-handed control over the art projects in Pitax, the academy bears a reputation for producing publicly funded affronts to good taste.</p><p>Fortunately, Headmistress Gitaren—who does have genuine talent and a wonderful singing voice—manages to rise above much of this. In the small hours of the morning, the few talented students and teachers attending the academy put their skills to work, creating marvelous works of art that remain, for the most part, unseen by the rest of Pitax.

If he does manage to survive (either alone or with some of his allies), Irovetti still effectively abandons his role as king, and any of his remaining allies are quick to abandon the region or even beg for forgiveness from the PCs. In this case, you can either have Irovetti leave the region and never return or have him continue to plague the PCs from the wilderness as he attempts to recruit new allies. He might even find his way to Thousandbreaths and beg for aid from Nyrissa, in which case the nymph is likely to either imprison him in her domain or transform him into some sort of strange new monster to serve as a guardian. In the latter event, feel free to pick one of the monsters the PCs face in @UUID[JournalEntry.geHtEMsUzqsld8cx]{Chapter 10}, and when that creature is slain, its body shrinks down to reveal it was Irovetti all along.</p><p>If the PCs capture Irovetti alive, interrogating him can help the PCs learn more about Nyrissa—this development is detailed at the start of Chapter 10. Whether or not a captured Irovetti can be redeemed is left to the GM to determine.</p><h2>A Chance to Relax</h2><p>With the defeat of King Irovetti, the PCs have earned a chance to relax. For the months following this triumph, give them all the time they wish to recover and rebuild their kingdom from the damage caused by the war, and allow them to continue exploring the Stolen Lands and expanding their kingdom at their own pace.

There are two categories of kingdom events: story events that occur as a result of the campaign plotline and random events.</p><p>Story events are resolved when they occur, as detailed in the earlier chapters of this Adventure Path and often include greater details for how the PCs can take part in resolving the event. These events take place during regular play even though they draw upon kingdom statistics. They’re usually resolved during downtime.</p><p>Random events are resolved entirely by the kingdom itself and take place within the @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.haAwaaMEbW4BWAuK]{Event phase} of a Kingdom turn. A flat check at the start of this phase determines whether a random event occurs, although you could roll this check in advance for any number of Kingdom turns or even just choose which events are going to take place for a span of time. Determining the events that will play out in advance gives you the ability to build narratives during play to foreshadow upcoming events (so that when they occur, they aren’t completely unexpected) and might inspire interesting ways to combine events with the ongoing campaign’s story.</p><h2>Resolving Kingdom Events</h2><p>All kingdom events resolve in downtime, although for some story events, there may be periods of exploration or encounter mode before or after an event’s resolution. Some kingdom events grant boons or benefits, while others can harm a kingdom by costing resources, increasing Unrest or Ruin, penalizing activities, or damaging structures. In many cases, the PCs will be able to attempt Kingdom skill checks to bolster benefits or minimize disasters.</p><p>It’s possible to have more than one kingdom event occur during a Kingdom turn.

Each kingdom event has a list of traits that convey its properties at a glance. <strong>Beneficial</strong> events provide boons and benefits to the kingdom. <strong>Dangerous</strong> events threaten the kingdom. <strong>Continuous</strong> events play out during multiple consecutive Event phases until the event has been resolved (see the event’s Resolution entry). <strong>Hex</strong> events take place in a specific hex in the kingdom, while <strong>Settlement</strong> events take place in a specific settlement—skill checks to resolve these events receive item bonuses only from structures that influence that hex (in the case of a hex event) or that are part of that settlement (in the case of a settlement event). Hex and Settlement events’ effects may be enhanced or diminished if the site has (or lacks) specific features.</p><p><strong>Location</strong> This entry explains how to determine where a hex or settlement event takes place; the entry is omitted from kingdom-wide events.</p><p><strong>Event</strong> The event’s effect on the kingdom is described here, along with any skill checks that can be attempted to affect the event.</p><p><strong>Kingdom Skill</strong> This lists the Kingdom skill that’s used to determine the outcome of the event, along with any situational modifiers; <strong>Leader</strong> PC leaders are particularly helpful in resolving events.

As the PCs’ nation grows, many of their subjects begin to trade tales about her. Rumors spread that the old woman is a hag, and locals begin calling her the Swamp Witch, claiming (falsely) that she sold her soul to a demon or devil for malign powers. In reality, Elga Verniex isn’t a witch at all, just a bitter old woman who likes her privacy, though her magical powers are legitimate.</p></section><p>Elga doesn’t take kindly to visitors, and to help ensure her privacy, she has animated a pumpkin-headed scarecrow to guard her hut and drive away unwanted guests. Those who regularly come to her for assistance have long since learned to announce their presence before opening her gate.</p><p>The Old Beldame’s hut is a simple, one-room affair; it’s about 20 feet in diameter with a dirt floor and a thatched roof. The rafters are hung with dried herbs and swamp weeds, and a bubbling cauldron (containing nothing more sinister than a weak vegetable broth) hangs over a firepit in the center of the room. The region around the hut is an 80-foot-diameter area of solid ground, thick with bog grass and dotted with small, cattail-clogged pools. This area is surrounded by a waist-high wooden fence, in which a single gate hangs askew. A fist-sized, rusted iron bell hangs from a hairy length of rope tied to a crooked post next to the gate.</p><p>The scarecrow appears to be propped up midway between the gate and the door to the hut—it lurches to life and swiftly moves to attack anyone crossing the line of the fence. The Old Beldame does not emerge from her hut, even if the PCs fight the scarecrow outside. She is somewhat hard of hearing anyway and trusts the scarecrow to take care of any troublesome intruders. She attacks only if the PCs make it past the scarecrow and enter her hut uninvited. She is initially unfriendly to PCs, but she is not evil-hearted, so successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:15|traits:action:make-an-impression] checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression} may be able to defuse the situation before it turns violent.</p><p>The Old Beldame is human, although fey blood runs in her veins—over the years, her magical heritage has given her skin a strange greenish cast and lengthened her ears to points, further fuel for the locals’ rumormongering. Should the PCs wish to talk to Elga instead of fighting her, they’d do well to announce themselves by striking the bell on the pole next to the gate before they annoy the scarecrow. The Old Beldame peers out of a window of her hut and angrily demands to know who the PCs are. Initial diplomatic contact must be carried out at this somewhat awkward distance, for if the PCs enter her fenced-in area, she shrieks, ducks into her hut, and lets the scarecrow handle the defense of her domain.

In order to prepare for his coup, he gathered and devoured several dozen of the knot’s sacred blue dragonflies, hoping to gain great power and skill from the insects. Alas, while the feast bolstered his self-confidence, it did nothing for his battle skills. He rode his slurk Ubagub into the center of M’botuu to declare war, whereupon he was immediately captured. @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.GM5bmf3HiUN2tBP4]{M’botuu}’s ruler, @UUID[Actor.sedubjznhIbVfCkD]{Sepoko}, sentenced Garuum and his slurk to death after a day of humiliating punishment.</p><p>Fortunately, Garuum’s captors forgot about him after getting drunk on bog whiskey.

Following his escape, the priest-king branded Garuum an exile and demanded that he be slain on sight should he ever return.</p></section><p>Garuum knows his previous life is over and has made do as best he can. He moved into this ruined village and thinks of the two ruined buildings within as his empire. Garuum sleeps in a nest made of swamp reeds, soggy planks, and mud in the ruins of the smaller building’s tower. Neither he nor Ubagub react kindly to intruders, each croaking loudly to alert the other. Yet Garuum has learned from his past mistakes—now he moderates his violent impulses. He even knows several words of Common.</p><p>As soon as he sees the PCs (and assuming they don’t immediately attack him or Ubagub), Garuum holds up his hands and croaks out, “Truce! Truce!” Garuum just wants to be left alone, but his limited knowledge of Common (the only words he knows are boggard, bug, slurk, snake, truce, hungry, me, you, die, and go) might make communication difficult. Garuum is quick to interpret attempts to search his “kingdom” or simply to walk through it as offensive acts, and attacks.</p><p>If the PCs establish a line of communication with the boggard, he tells them his story and that he doesn’t want to cause problems; if the PCs leave him be, he’ll reciprocate.

The nixie, @UUID[Actor.RTd4FwqGq8gBjdAO]{Melianse}, did not take kindly to the loggers despoiling her home and unsuccessfully attempted to scare them off with ample use of @UUID[Actor.RTd4FwqGq8gBjdAO.Item.5kg7JjXt6IFWf6Wf]{ghost sound} and @UUID[Actor.RTd4FwqGq8gBjdAO.Item.veuImnnlVr4xjZzt]{obscuring mist}. When that tactic failed, Melianse took the time to inveigle one of the lumberjacks, and then another, and both now stand guard in front of her pool. Since both are good workers, @UUID[Actor.48o307dry03xazvd]{Corax} has resisted the urge to fight his own employees, but he is fast losing patience with the nixie and fears the blow to his reputation in his workers’ eyes if he dithers much longer. The two groups are now in a standoff, with neither willing to make the next move.</p><p>When the PCs arrive on the scene, Corax and six of his eight @UUID[Actor.UAlHSl6Cpujld1dx]{loggers} stand angrily near the felled trees, about 30 feet from the pool. The other two lumberjacks stand at the water’s edge, facing Corax. Melianse floats in the center of the pool with only her head above water; she remains about 20 feet from the shore, out of the loggers’ reach, and silently observes their response.</p><p>As soon as Corax notices the PCs, he sees them as potential allies. He quickly hails them and explains the situation in a gruff voice liberally laced with profanity, claiming that the nixie attacked his workers unprovoked and complaining bitterly about how hard it is for “a decent man to make a living with all these damnable fairies in the woods.” Melianse responds calmly to this accusation, claiming that she politely asked the loggers to leave at first but was forced to enchant two of them after Corax threatened to hang her from the nearest tree “to drip dry.” She adds that the trees felled by the loggers had been growing next to the pool for more than 200 years and deserved a far better fate than serving as “some grubby peasant’s slop table.” Both Corax and Melianse appeal to the PCs for help. The conversation soon devolves into more accusations and shouted insults.</p><p>Unless action is taken by the PCs to defuse the situation, Corax eventually loses patience and orders his six unaffected lumberjacks to subdue their entranced colleagues and attack the nixie. Melianse responds by ordering the inveigled loggers to defend her pool while she targets Corax with her spells. If the PCs ally with Corax, Melianse focuses her magic on them. If the PCs ally with Melianse, Corax orders three loggers to focus on Melianse while he and the other three fight the PCs. Corax surrenders if reduced to 10 or fewer Hit Points, vowing to practice his trade “someplace where the damned fairies don’t run the show!” Melianse fights to the death to defend her home.</p></section><p>If the PCs want to defuse the situation, they must negotiate an accord between the two parties. First, Corax and Melianse, both of whom are quite angry, must be calmed down and convinced to talk. Diplomacy or Intimidation checks might work (both Corax and Melianse are unfriendly to the PCs at the start of the encounter), or spells such as charm or calm emotions can be used (although if they fail, both sides might be spurred to attack the PCs). Once the two agree to negotiate, both must be satisfied with the result. Corax wants his lumber and demands that Melianse release his two workers from her influence. Melianse wants the loggers to leave her glade and provide reparation for the trees they’ve already felled.</p><p>Obviously, there is no single correct answer to appease everyone; reward players who come up with creative solutions as long as both groups get something out of the negotiations. (One possible solution is to provide the loggers with another source of lumber; a PC who succeeds at a @Check[type:nature|dc:18] or Forest Lore check recalls an untouched grove of coachwood trees 10 miles to the north, near the old tatzlwyrm den, that the lumberjacks can freely harvest if shown the way to the grove.) For her part, Melianse releases the two entranced loggers if the group leaves and replaces the three trees they’ve cut down (as detailed in the quest Melianse’s Trees below).</p><section class=\"quest\"><header class=\"split\"><h3 class=\"creature-name\">Melianse’s Trees</h3><ul class=\"traits\"><li>30 XP</li></ul></header><article><p>The PCs must replace three trees that have been cut down in the prime of their lives. Melianse doesn’t care how the PCs replace the three trees, nor does she care what kind of trees they replace the felled ones with. She simply wants three new trees planted in her glade to help restore her home.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong> Melianse (area TW1)</p><p><strong>Completion:</strong> The easiest solution to this quest involves gathering three tree feather tokens and placing them near the three felled trees. If the PCs don’t think of this, the nixie can suggest it, recommending they contact the dryad Tiressia to the northwest (area @UUID[.bLxVZCuHjKPssNXv]{KL1}). Melianse knows the dryad has a few of these feather tokens but suspects Tiressia will want a favor before handing over the tokens (Melianse doesn’t know about @UUID[.bLxVZCuHjKPssNXv]{the scythe tree problem} facing the dryad). Alternatively, the PCs could buy three of these feather tokens from a merchant in a city.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> Not only does Melianse agree to release the two inveigled lumberjacks from her control, she also agrees to teach the PCs the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5pwK2FZX6QwgtfqX]{inveigle} ritual if they wish. Once the PCs establish their kingdom, Melianse agrees to keep an eye out along the Greenbelt’s rivers for any trouble or rumors of danger, and to spread word of the PCs’ reasonable nature to other fey.

He made no judgments on those who chose to use his bridge. Be they bandit or trapper, as long as they had the coin, he allowed them to cross the Shrike. As this crossing was the only significant one in the region, Davik made a fair amount of money for his hard work.</p><p>Unfortunately, after he finally made enough to recoup the cost of building the rope bridge, @UUID[JournalEntry.PoopszF8pbV8RtX8.JournalEntryPage.70FiR5COVuuS28ZD]{the Stag Lord} rose to power downriver on the north shore of the Tuskwater. When the Stag Lord paid a visit to the crossing, he informed Davik that not only were the men bearing the Stag Lord’s badge to be granted free passage over the bridge, but that Davik would now have to pay the Stag Lord two-thirds of his monthly take in return for “protection.” In his response to the Stag Lord’s demands, Davik made a foolish error. He not only refused the offer, but ran the bandit and his men off with his trusty ranseur and the aid of his three slavering hounds. After the incident, Davik rewarded himself with a meal of fresh fish and went to bed early. Not surprisingly, the Stag Lord did not stay away for long.</p><p>In the dead of night, the bandits returned. They surrounded Davik’s house and set it on fire with flaming arrows. Davik woke in terror to his dogs’ barking, and as he stumbled out of his burning home, ranseur in hand, the bandits attacked. His polearm provided little help as the archers’ flaming arrows rained down, killing his hounds and wounding Davik. With his nightshirt aflame, the doomed bridge keeper tumbled down the path toward the river. After dousing himself with water, he clambered up to the bridge and tried to escape to the north shore.</p><p>The bandits followed, and as Davik passed the midpoint on his bridge, the Stag Lord and his men cut several ropes. The bridge collapsed, plunging the shrieking Davik into the river below. Though he struggled mightily to swim ashore, the current was too much and he drowned. Onshore, the bandits watched, gleefully chuckling, their leering shadows dancing before the hovel’s flames as it burned down to cinders. The Stag Lord returned to his fort, leaving behind several bandits to rebuild the bridge and take up the position of toll taker.</p><p>The next night, as the bandits argued over who would get to be the bridge’s new “boss,” Davik rose from the river as an undead thing of vengeance. He stalked out of the water, weapon in hand, and murdered the brigands before dragging their bodies into the river. The Stag Lord sent more bandits to investigate several days later, and though Davik rose again to kill most of them, three escaped to report back to their leader. The Stag Lord wisely decided to abandon his plans to rebuild the bridge, and in the months since, has all but forgotten about Davik and his tolls.</p><p>Today, Nettle's Crossing is a soggy, abandoned remnant. One thick and sagging rope still hangs across the river, all that remains of the bridge that once spanned it. A signpost at either end of the ruined bridge reads “Nettles’ Crossing—5 coppers—ring bell for service.” A rusty bell hangs by each sign.

Falchos follows this with his own spells if necessary. The two fey do not otherwise attack the PCs unless they’re attacked first.

Resource points do not directly represent amounts of coins in a treasury, but rather an abstraction of the nation’s total amount of available funds to handle tasks. Since luck and demand play a part in a kingdom’s resources, the exact total of RP a kingdom will have each turn varies; a new total of RP is rolled at the start of each Kingdom turn (page 538) using Resource Dice. Any RP not spent by the end of that turn convert to kingdom XP at a rate of 1 RP to 1 XP. Whenever the kingdom is forced to spend RP that would drop it below 0, spend all the RP the kingdom has and then increase a Ruin of the PCs’ choice by 1.</p><h3>Resource Dice</h3><p>A kingdom’s economy is based on the sum of the productive activity of its citizens, and that activity is reflected in a quantity of resources that the kingdom can tap into each month. These resources are represented by Resource Points (see below) which are determined by Resource Dice, with the number of dice being equal to the nation’s level + 4. When a kingdom is first founded, each Resource Die is a d4, but as the kingdom advances in Size, its Resource Die increases to d6, d8, d10, or d12 (see the @UUID[.kitlt28oPiGVyHCH]{Kingdom Size} table).</p><h2>Commodities</h2><p>As a kingdom grows, it stockpiles resources beyond those required for day‑to‑day life. These resources are known as Commodities and are used to build structures in settlements, to trade for @UUID[.lCLywHaoPOPdhXrm]{RP} using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.swAA2zetF14HIhUc]{Trade Commodities} activity, or to expend during kingdom events.</p><p>The types of Commodities that are available include Food, Lumber, Luxuries, Ore, and Stone. As kingdoms accumulate or expend these Commodities, track the numbers on the kingdom sheet. Unless specialized storage improvements have been built in its settlements, a kingdom is limited to a maximum number of stored Commodities in each category as determined by its @UUID[.kitlt28oPiGVyHCH]{Size}. Commodities gathered in excess of this storage limit are lost.</p><p>Each type of Commodity can be gathered by special activities as detailed below, but Commodities can also be discovered via kingdom events or while exploring the Stolen Lands, earned as rewards for quests, purchased from allies via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.VadpbmRYNXSX7g8z]{Purchase Commodities}, or acquired via @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.3qJcDEZNwJV6hpkg]{Establishing Trade Agreements}.</p><p><strong>Food</strong> stockpiles are expended to pay for Consumption during the Upkeep phase of a Kingdom turn, but also when faced with famines or other disasters, and to keep armies fed during times of war (as described in those events). Food is gathered with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.o81alpjEki9cESun]{Harvest Crops}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.rXNZTmesfoBln2vs]{Go Fishing}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.l0Wlgj6LaDNRRUa6]{Gather Livestock}.</p><p><strong>Lumber</strong> is used to build structures during the Civic Activities step of the Activity phase of a Kingdom turn, and it is gathered from lumber camps built by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.8B6PmgtMH2TthBSX]{Establish Work Site}.</p><p><strong>Luxuries</strong> are used to build specialized structures or are expended during certain encounters, generally those with high stakes or magical effects.

                            "text": "<p>All kingdoms have leaders who fill roles tending to the economy, defense, and health of its citizens. Each role grants the kingdom different benefits, provided a character—be it a PC or an NPC—takes up the mantle of serving in that role. A character can only fill one leadership role at a time, but it’s important to have all eight roles filled, for when a kingdom goes without a leader, problems arise.</p><p>If unexpected events (such as the death of a character) remove a leader from a leadership role, the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.vHKPoZycxZAA1vpz]{New Leadership} kingdom activity may immediately be used to assign a new leader to that role—even outside of a Kingdom turn.</p><p>Each character in a leadership role (whether PC or NPC) must spend a week of downtime activity each month attending to their duties (though these seven days need not be consecutive). This downtime works just the same as time spent retraining a feat or skill; a character can take multiple downtime activities during the course of a month as time allows. A character can attend to their duties even if they take on a downtime activity with a longer time requirement (such as retraining a class feature, which requires at least a month); in this case, simply break up the time required for that longer activity over the course of consecutive months, leaving seven days during each month for leadership activities. NPCs assigned to leadership roles are presumed to meet the downtime requirement automatically unless the PCs deliberately have them step away from the job (likely to accompany them on adventures). If a character does not spend this downtime, at the start of the @UUID[.WWGNrRZ1dkTjz5Il]{Upkeep phase} of the next Kingdom turn, they either incur their role’s vacancy penalty (see below) or lose one of their leadership activities for that turn.</p><p>There is an advantage to assigning a leadership role to a PC rather than an NPC. Each @UUID[JournalEntry.36YItDu6VgX6IRWV.JournalEntryPage.VAhDGpHpEexUkszK]{kingdom event} specifies a leader, and if that leader is a PC who is not incurring a vacancy penalty, the kingdom receives a bonus to the kingdom check that determines the event’s outcome.</p><p>Some benefits require that a role be invested. In step 7 of @UUID[.oBEEIVtLmNIN3meL]{Kingdom Creation}, the players select 4 leadership roles to be invested; at the start of each Kingdom turn, they may reselect the roles that are invested (see Assign Leadership Roles). Note that when certain companions detailed in the Kingmaker Companion Guide hold the leadership roles listed in their entry in that book, those roles are automatically invested; this is in addition to the four roles the players choose to invest.</p><h3>Role Mechanics</h3><p><strong>Key Ability</strong>: This lists the kingdom ability score that is most impacted by the leader. When this role is invested, all Kingdom skill checks based on this ability gain a +1 status bonus. This bonus increases to +2 when the kingdom reaches 8th level, and then to +3 when the kingdom reaches 16th level.</p><p>Since status bonuses don’t stack (see @UUID[.0thiaA1x5SKtPES5]{Kingdom Skill Checks}), you may want to invest one role that benefits each of the 4 kingdom abilities—but since each leadership role offers other unique benefits to the kingdom, spreading out the roles in that way may not always be the best choice!</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty</strong>: At the start of each Kingdom turn, if any leader has not spent the required week of downtime in that role (see above) since the end of the last Kingdom turn, they must either give up one of the three activities they would take during the Leadership Activities step of the Activity phase, or apply this penalty until the start of the next Kingdom turn. (When the vacancy penalty ends, any Unrest generated by the vacancy remains in place and must be ameliorated in the normal fashion.)

The mechanics treat the kingdom itself as a sort of additional character in the party, so players who know how to navigate and level up their own characters should find managing a kingdom relatively easy.</p><p>Though these rules use the word “kingdom” to refer to the nation ruled by the PCs, their government doesn’t need to be a monarchy.

If you wish to use these rules to run kingdoms outside of Kingmaker, you may need to adjust these rules to fit your game.</p><h3>Working Together</h3><p>More so than typical Pathfinder campaigns, Kingmaker assumes that the PCs work together.

All Kingdom skill checks made to resolve issues associated with secondary territories take a –4 circumstance penalty. When a kingdom starts a turn with any number of secondary territories, increase Unrest by 1. Once a secondary territory is connected to the primary territory via at least one hex, it becomes part of the primary territory.</p><p>If a kingdom is reduced to 0 hexes, whether through Unrest, a disaster, war with another kingdom, or any other effect, the PCs are at risk of having their rule end.

It’s best if the party works together to assign these roles. Then, assign any remaining roles to NPCs whom the PCs have allied with and who are capable and willing to serve in a leadership role.</p><p>Next, choose four leadership roles to invest. Investing a role provides a status bonus to Kingdom skill checks based on that role’s key ability (see Key Ability on page 514 and table on 516). Invest roles assigned to PCs first (so if your party has fewer than four PCs, you’ll invest only enough NPC roles to make up the difference).</p><p>These initial leadership assignments happen as part of the founding of the kingdom and do not require a kingdom activity to occur.

These proficiency ranks cannot be reassigned later.</p><p>On the kingdom sheet, record the leader you assigned to each role and indicate the four roles you invested.

Ruin rises and falls as Kingdom turns progress, but if it rises too high, it can cause lasting or even permanent harm to the kingdom.</p><p><strong>Accruing Ruin</strong>: As Ruin accumulates, the categories gain points. These point totals are persistent, decreasing only in specific circumstances, but most often when a Ruin’s point total exceeds that Ruin’s threshold. Other events can reduce or increase a Ruin’s point total as well—typically as the result of kingdom activities or events.</p><p><strong>Ruin Threshold</strong>: Each Ruin has a threshold; a point at which the penalties associated with that Ruin increase. A Ruin’s initial threshold is 10, but each threshold increases as the kingdom levels up and becomes more able to withstand Ruin in all its forms. Whenever a Ruin exceeds its threshold, reduce that Ruin’s total points by an amount equal to its threshold, and increase the Ruin’s penalty by 1.</p><p><strong>Ruin Penalty</strong>: A Ruin penalty applies to all checks using that Ruin’s associated ability score. For example, if your kingdom has a Corruption penalty of –4, it takes a –4 item penalty on all Culture checks. Reducing Ruin Penalties: When a kingdom reaches 5th level, and then again every 3 levels thereafter, it gains Ruin resistance; each time it does so, it has the opportunity to reduce an existing Ruin penalty to 0. This is an extremely effective way to manage a Ruin penalty that’s crept particularly high, but it’s also an extremely limited resource, as a kingdom will only get, at most, 6 opportunities to adjust a Ruin penalty in this way over the course of a campaign. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.li7WowfuIbGmCxKo]{Repair Reputation} activity can reduce existing Ruin penalties, although at a much slower rate. Other activities or events can reduce Ruin penalties as well, as detailed in the text for each. Finally, if circumstances ever allow for a Ruin’s points to be reduced and that particular Ruin is already at 0 points, instead of reducing Ruin to a negative value you can instead attempt a DC 16 flat check; on a success, reduce that Ruin’s penalty by 1 to a minimum of 0.</p>",

They entrusted <em>Briar's</em> safe keeping to the Lantern King, who mischievously kept moving the sword from world to world, always near to the regions Nyrissa was focused on but always hidden from her so that he could privately enjoy the delicious irony that the thing she sought so ardently was always kept just out of reach.</p><p>When first recovered by the PCs, Briar is a <em>+3 greater striking cold iron bastard sword</em>, but its additional powers remain dormant. These powers can be awakened as the PCs progress through Chapter 10. The process of awakening Briar requires that the weapon be present when First World blooms are defeated or when powerful creatures from the First World are slain-<em>Briar </em>need not be the weapon that defeats a bloom or slays a monster, but it must be in the immediate area (within 500 feet). Defeating a bloom or slaying a 17th-level or greater monster from the First World- including all creatures closely associated with a bloom-gives <em>Briar</em> a Sharpness Point. As it accumulates these points, it gains additional powers, as detailed below.</p><p>Once <em>Briar </em>gains the capability to speak, it can relate to its partner the sad tale of its creation, including the fact that it was created by the Lantern King using Nyrissa's capacity to love. <em>Briar </em>knows that without love, Nyrissa is as good as dead, and it suspects that only by being used to slay Nyrissa can it be returned to her soul. It doesn't know about the Lantern King's additional machinations, the nature of the <em>Apology</em>, or Nyrissa's reasons for attacking the Stolen Lands, and as such doesn't realize there is another method to be reunited with the nymph queen-see the end of Chapter 10.</p><p>The first time <em>Briar </em>is brought within 30 feet of Nyrissa, it automatically gains enough Sharpness Points to reach 20 points.</p><hr /><p><strong>Destruction</strong> The Lantern King can will <em>Briar's</em> destruction if he chooses. Alternately, defeating the Lantern King's aspect causes the sword's destruction. Once <em>Briar </em>is destroyed, Nyrissa regains the capability to love once again, but what she does next will depend on how the PCs treated her-assuming she survives.</p><p>If Nyrissa is slain, <em>Briar </em>immediately loses [[/r {1d6} #sharpness points]]{1d6 Sharpness points}. It can never again gain Sharpness points, and it continues to lose more at the rate of 1d6 every 24 hours. Once <em>Briar's</em> Sharpness points drop to 0 in this way, the sword is destroyed.</p><article class=\"blockgroup\"><section class=\"stats block\"><p><strong>1 Sharpness Point</strong> <em>Briar</em> becomes a <em>+3 greater striking shifting cold iron bastard sword.</em></p></section><section class=\"block stats\"><p><strong>4 Sharpness Points</strong> <em>Briar</em> becomes a <em>+3 major striking shifting cold iron bastard sword</em>.

The @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7]{Kingdoms} journal contains non-spoiler information and rules for how to set up and run a kingdom of your own, and will hopefully be of use when it's time for your group to begin @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.HSLlW9iEZXiQzQpy]{Creating your Kingdom}. In the meantime, though, it could be a good idea for the players and gamemaster to have a discussion about their plans, goals, and expectations. Below are some broad topics for the group to consider.</p><p><strong>Working Together</strong>: More so than typical Pathfinder campaigns, Kingmaker assumes that the PCs work together. These rules assume that all of the PCs have roles as leaders in the nation, and that they’re all focused on making their kingdom prosperous and stable, rather than stealing from the treasury, oppressing the citizens (or each other), or striking out on their own to start competing kingdoms. Before starting this campaign, you should make sure that everyone understands this assumption and builds appropriate characters.</p><p><strong>Leadership Roles</strong>: It could also be a good idea to consider the leadership roles as you create your party, as this will allow you to build characters for specific roles within a team. Remember, though these rules use the word “kingdom” to refer to the nation ruled by the PCs, the government doesn’t need to be a monarchy. Likewise, titles like “queen” or “king” may differ from the terms the PCs choose for their leaders (and in any case, gender has no mechanical role in the kingdom rules).</p><p><strong>Sharing the Load: </strong>Ruling a kingdom takes a lot of time, with the majority of actual game-play of running the kingdom taking place during downtime. These mechanics treat the kingdom itself as a sort of additional character in the party, so players who know how to navigate and level up their own characters should find managing a kingdom relatively straightforward. The GM and other players should work together to determine how best to keep track of their kingdom. Should the GM keep track of everything ? Should one player (perhaps the one in the Ruler @UUID[JournalEntry.ufhwExwde2g3iEa7.JournalEntryPage.MWil0VWMcs66syY8]{leadership role}) always be responsible for filling out the kingdom sheet, while other players are responsible for different settlements ? Should the kingdom sheet pass from one player to the next each session or each time the kingdom levels up? There’s no one right answer, so use the solution that works best for your group.</p><p><strong>Kingdom in the Background</strong>: Not every group will be interested in the details of how a kingdom is built and managed. In such a case, the GM can allow the PCs’ kingdom to develop and grow in the background of the story. Resource encounters during hexploration become largely flavor discoveries in this case, and while you can still run Kingdom events as they occur during the campaign, their mechanical effects and repercussions should limit themselves to those that affect the PCs directly.</p><p><strong>Making Big Changes</strong>: In Kingmaker, a kingdom’s government type cannot be altered once chosen. Should the GM wish to allow a full regime change, it should cause significant events involving an adventure of its own, or at the very least should force the PC leaders to endure several Kingdom turns of anarchy. A full exploration of the story potential of regime changes are beyond the scope of these rules and of the Kingmaker Adventure Path. That said, if the PCs are seriously unhappy with a choice they made earlier regarding their kingdom’s government—or their sponsor or initial capital for that matter—the GM should consider simply letting the players retcon their choices and rebuild the kingdom with a new choice of government for the sake of keeping the campaign going!</p>"

Many attempts have been made to settle them, but to date, none have succeeded, making these 35,000 square miles of wilderness the largest swath of unclaimed land in the entire River Kingdoms. As tensions mount in Brevoy, one of Rostland’s swordlords hopes to change that fact; she plans to issue charters to several groups of adventurers, sending them south into the Stolen Lands to reopen old trade routes and defeat the bandits and monsters who have made them too dangerous to use. By sending free agents south, this swordlord of Rostland hopes to create new allies without sacrificing her own position of power in Brevoy.</p><p>Yet as with most complex and brilliant plans, the future holds plenty of opportunities for disaster.</p></aside><p>The Kingmaker Adventure Path begins as the player characters attend a feast at Lady Jamandi Aldori’s manor in Brevoy, where she reveals to all those in attendance her plans to transform the Stolen Lands into a new nation. After a night of unexpected chaos, where the PCs get their first chance to impress Lady Aldori by helping to defend her home against a group of criminals, they’re given their first assignment. The PCs are sent into the Stolen Lands to begin taming the wilderness, with the goal of eventually establishing a brand new nation.</p><p>Before they can get truly started, though, they need to begin exploring the wilderness. Using a remote trading post (which is also dealing with frequent bandit raids) as an initial base of operations, the PCs start to explore and map the Stolen Lands. It won’t be long before they clash against the most dangerous bandits in the region—a band led by a notorious villain known as the Stag Lord. Locating the Stag Lord’s base of operations requires exploration and, when the fort is discovered, careful planning and a bit of luck to prevail against the Stag Lord and his brutal bandit minions.</p><p>With the Stag Lord’s defeat, the PCs establish themselves as a dominant force in the region, and they can begin to build. A wide range of threats reveal themselves as their kingdom grows, including a troll uprising, an attack by an immense owlbear, political operatives from the neighboring kingdom of Pitax waging a propaganda war, and a sinister cult of Lamashtu who hope to merge the magic of the First World with that of the Abyss. The greatest threat the PCs will face may go unnoticed at first. The nymph queen Nyrissa has been cursed by a demigod known as the Lantern King, and in order to escape her fate, she must destroy nations, and the PCs’ new kingdom sits at the top of her list to ruin.</p><p>When the population of nearby Varnhold vanishes, the PCs are drawn east into conflict with an ancient cyclops lich named Vordakai. By defeating him, the PCs’ nation grows significantly, drawing further attention from competitors to the east—the baron of the nearby town of Fort Drelev, the Tiger Lord barbarians, and the jealous ruler of the neighboring nation of Pitax. As the PCs clash against these new foes, their nation’s strength only grows, and in time it becomes a full‑fledged kingdom.</p><p>It’s at this point that the ruler of Pitax, King Irovetti, makes a fateful move. He invites the PCs to take part in a tournament, but this invitation is nothing more than a distraction during which he launches an attack on the PCs’ nation. The War of the River Kings follows, and if the PCs can defeat King Irovetti they’ll be able to ally with or even annex the city of Pitax, spread their kingdom further, and explore some of their realm’s most dangerous locations.</p><p>Eventually, the Stolen Lands are stolen no more, and become a thriving nation of their own under the rule of the player characters. It’s at this point the nymph queen Nyrissa makes her move and the PCs finally learn the true depth of her influence over the events they’ve experienced in the campaign. Nyrissa invades the PCs’ kingdom from the First World, infesting the realm with supernatural blooms of fey power and uprisings of strange and deadly monsters. The PCs must confront Nyrissa in her eerie realm if they wish to keep their kingdom. Yet with her defeat a greater truth is revealed. Whether the PCs defeat Nyrissa in combat or forgive her for her past misdeeds, the Lantern King grows angry. A final confrontation with this potent demigod will test the PCs to their limits, and could not only save Nyrissa from her fate but change the future of the River Kingdoms forever!</p>",

                            "text": "<p>Consider the following when creating your PC.</p><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Kingmaker works best if the PCs share at least one primary alignment in common, but as long as the players work well together any alignment can function in this campaign.</p><h3>Animal Companions/Familiars</h3><p>While a character with an animal companion or familiar is not limited in their choices in Kingmaker, the following animals are native to the region and thematically appropriate for this campaign: arboreal sapling, badger, bat, bear, bird, boar, cat, horse, riding drake, scorpion, snake, or wolf.</p><h3>Skills and Feats</h3><p>Wilderness exploration plays a major role in Kingmaker, which means that more action-based skills like Acrobatics and Athletics are as valuable as wilderness skills like Nature and Survival. The ability to track creatures is particularly useful in certain Kingmaker encounters. Social skills like Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation will be quite useful, particularly when the heroes are interacting with visitors or antagonists from neighboring realms. Strong choices for Lore specialties include Architecture, Banditry, Brevoy, Farming, First World, Fishing, Forest, Heraldry, Herbalism, Hills, Hunting, Iobaria, Labor, Mercantile, Mining, Mountains, Legal, Pitax, Plains, Politics, River, Scouting, Swamp, and Warfare. In addition, Lore skills focused on deities or types of creatures that play important roles in this campaign are excellent choices: Calistria, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, Gorum, Gozreh, and Shelyn are obvious choices for deity lore, along with Eldest Lore for knowledge of the pantheon of fey demigods; for creatures, the strongest thematic choices would include Boggard, Dragon, Fey, Kobold, Lizardfolk, and Troll Lore. If a player wants to choose a monster Lore, the GM should work with them to suggest options without spoiling too much.</p><h3>Archetypes</h3><p>All multiclass archetypes work well for a Kingmaker campaign. Other thematically appropriate archetypes from the Advanced Player’s Guide include archaeologist, assassin, beastmaster, bounty hunter, celebrity, herbalist, horizon walker, loremaster, marshal, scout, and snarecrafter. The Aldori Duelist archetype from the Pathfinder Lost Omens World Guide is an excellent thematic choice, as this campaign begins in Rostland, the home of this fighting style, and the PCs’ association with Jamandi Aldori is a great way to unlock access to this archetype.</p><h3>Building a Kingdom</h3><p>As the campaign progresses, players build their own kingdom, found settlements, and go to war with enemy nations. This Adventure Path’s rules for @UUID[.AkedyEf3bPMAT2RC]{Kingdoms}, @UUID[JournalEntry.BIu4C1T1RR17QNwl]{Settlements}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.TBY1Ir2GtQJqW8VD]{Warfare} should be provided to the players so that they can be familiar with them and reference them as needed during play.</p><h3>Languages</h3><p>Kingmaker takes place in the Stolen Lands, where Taldan is the most widespread language. Other strong choices for languages in Kingmaker include Aklo, Boggard, Cyclops, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnomish, Goblin, Hallit, Iruxi, Jotun, Necril, Sylvan.</p>",

A few things to keep in mind for each of the classes are summarized below.</p><article class=\"blockgroup\"><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.XwfcJuskrhI9GIjX]{Alchemist}</h3><p>While alchemy doesn’t play a particularly important role in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em>, an alchemist still has plenty of opportunities to shine in this campaign, particularly if they focus their research as chirurgeons or mutagenists.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.YDRiP7uVvr9WRhOI]{Barbarian}</h3><p>The most active barbarians within the Stolen Lands are the Tiger Lords, but they’re a violent band of warmongers who play the role of antagonists in the campaign. As such, the Tiger Lords make a poor choice for a PC affiliation. If a player wants their barbarian character to have an affiliation with a local group, work with your GM to generate specifics. If a player chooses to play a member of the Tiger Lords, GMs should work with them to ensure that they won’t have knowledge about the current activities of the group to avoid spoiling plotlines. An exiled Tiger Lord barbarian could make for a compelling character who eventually could help the party to more easily recruit the Tiger Lords as allies. The most thematic instincts for a Kingmaker barbarian include animal, dragon, and fury.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.3gweRQ5gn7szIWAv]{Bard}</h3><p>A bard’s ability to sway crowds and manipulate social events will often come in handy during Kingmaker. All bard muses are appropriate choices for Kingmaker, particularly if a bard’s specific muse is associated with Brevoy, the River Kingdoms, or the First World. King Irovetti, the ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Pitax, fancies himself a renowned artist and entertainer, yet stifles the artists in his realm, so a bard character who fled Pitax could have a ready-made goal to return and start a cultural revolution. Such a bard should not be someone who views King Irovetti as an ally or a source of inspiration, though!</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.x8iwnpdLbfcoZkHA]{Champion}</h3><p>Holy warriors are relatively uncommon in the River Kingdoms, though they are not completely absent from the region. Champions who serve Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, or Shelyn are the most thematically appropriate choices for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.EizrWvUPMS67Pahd]{Cleric}</h3><p>All nations have need of healers and spiritual leaders, but those struggling to find their footing at the edge of civilization benefit most from the presence of clerics. While clerics of any faith will find roles in this campaign, deities who have strong thematic ties to events in Kingmaker include Calistria, Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, Gorum, Gozreh, and Shelyn.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.7s57JDCaiYYCAdFx]{Druid}</h3><p>Druidic traditions are strong in the Stolen Lands, particularly those linked to the First World. The worship of Gozreh and members the Green Faith are the most common druidic traditions followed in the region, while the animal, leaf, and wild druidic orders are the most appropriate choices for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.8zn3cD6GSmoo1LW4]{Fighter}</h3><p>The esteemed and exclusive schools of the Aldori swordlords train many of Brevoy’s numerous fighters, especially in the southern region of Rostland, so Kingmaker is an excellent opportunity to play a character interested in eventually becoming a swordlord. Alternately, with a focus on mass combat later in the story, a fighter who builds toward a role as a general can be an appropriate choice.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Z9li154CPNmun29Q]{Gunslinger}</h3><p>The people of Brevoy and the River Kingdoms know about guns, but these weapons remain incredibly rare in the region. As this is an uncommon class, a player should work with their GM before building a gunslinger, and the GM should be comfortable adjusting the campaign as needed to support this type of character’s specialized resource needs.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.30qVs46dVNflgQNx]{Inventor}</h3><p>Inventors certainly exist in Brevoy and the River Kingdoms, particularly those who are influenced by the futuristic technology of neighboring Numeria. Since rules for advanced technology are not available for Pathfinder Second Edition at this time, a player could reskin and adjust descriptions of an inventor PC’s abilities and creations to give them a Numerian feel, provided the GM approves. As with the gunslinger, since this is an uncommon class, the player should work with their GM before building an inventor.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.4wrSCyX6akmyo7Wj]{Investigator}</h3><p>There are plenty of mysteries in the Stolen Lands, and an investigator will have plenty to do throughout this campaign. All investigator methodologies are thematically appropriate for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.HQBA9Yx2s8ycvz3C]{Magus}</h3><p>While there are no significant organizations associated with this class in the Stolen Lands, the magus is hardly unknown to the people of Brevoy or the River Kingdoms. All categories of hybrid study for the magus work well for the campaign.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.YPxpk9JbMnKjbNLc]{Monk}</h3><p>As there are no established or significant monastic orders in the Stolen Lands or the surrounding regions, a traveling explorer or pilgrim likely makes the most sense for a monk character. A monk who seeks to establish their own order may well find an opportunity to do so while the party’s kingdom expands.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.pWHx4SXcft9O2udP]{Oracle}</h3><p>Oracles are an excellent thematic choice for this campaign, particularly their curses, though it’s probably best to keep an oracle’s curse self-contained rather than shoehorn it into larger plots in the campaign. The most thematically appropriate mysteries for an oracle are ancestors, battle, life, and tempest.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Inq4gH3P5PYjSQbD]{Psychic}</h3><p>Psychics are not well-known in the Stolen Lands, and most who encounter one would be quick to assume the character is some sort of sorcerer. Emotional acceptance is a strong thematic choice for your subconscious mind.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Yix76sfxrIlltSTJ]{Ranger}</h3><p>The Stolen Lands make ranger an excellent choice for Kingmaker, especially if the player wants to play a bounty hunter, ex-bandit, explorer, or survivalist.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.LO9STvskJemPkiAI]{Rogue}</h3><p>As with bards, rogues will find many opportunities to manipulate social encounters throughout the campaign. An ex-bandit or a bounty hunter might be a good choice for a rogue character, as would something like a spy or even a diplomat. All rogue rackets are sound choices for Kingmaker.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.15Yc1r6s9CEhSTMe]{Sorcerer}</h3><p>Kingmaker’s thematic ties to the First World make the fey and nymph bloodlines obvious choices for a sorcerer character. While any bloodline will have a chance to stand out, other bloodlines that have thematic ties to Kingmaker include draconic, elemental, and imperial.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.YtOm245r8GFSFYeD]{Summoner}</h3><p>Summoners of the Godcaller tradition are the most commonly encountered summoners in the region. The best choices, thematically, for a Kingmaker summoner’s eidolon include beast, dragon, fey, and plant.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.uJ5aCzlw34GGdWjp]{Swashbuckler}</h3><p>Although swashbucklers are often portrayed as counterculture elements that make their names as rebels or oppositional forces to the government, swashbucklers can find plenty of opportunities to excel and stand out in Kingmaker. As long as a swashbuckler character supports the party’s kingdom, all swashbuckler styles are thematically appropriate.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.Y5GsHqzCzJlKka6x]{Thaumaturge}</h3><p>Thaumaturges in the region are often misunderstood as investigators, wizards, or other scholars. All thaumaturge implements have use in this campaign, but your GM may have suggestions about specific choices that might mesh well with the game’s theme.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.bYDXk9HUMKOuym9h]{Witch}</h3><p>Witches are quite appropriate for a Kingmaker campaign, particularly if they choose a thematically synergistic patron. Curse, fate, and wild are the most relevant choices.</p></section><section class=\"block\"><h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classes.Item.RwjIZzIxzPpUglnK]{Wizard}</h3><p>There are no specific arcane traditions of note in the Stolen Lands, making this an excellent opportunity for a wizard character to establish a school of their own in their kingdom. Any choice of arcane thesis works well for the campaign.</p></section></article>"

While there’s more than enough content in this massive book to bring a party of PCs from 1st to 20th level, Game Masters who want to expand upon the adventure should check out the <a href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq02e0m\" title=\"Kingmaker Companion Guide\">Kingmaker Companion Guide</a>, a 128‑page book that presents several NPC companions drawn from the Pathfinder: Kingmaker video game, each with their own player options and additional quests ready to enhance your playthrough of Kingmaker. The Companion Guide also includes additional details to spice up the exploration of the Stolen Lands, from a robust system of downtime actions the PCs can take while camping in the wilds, to rules for how weather related events and hazards can complicate exploration. As with all of Paizo’s Adventure Paths, Kingmaker has a lively community <a href=\"http://localhost:30000/paizo.com/community/forums\" title=\"Paizo Forum\">forum</a> online. There, you’ll find great GM advice, helpful tools to make your game better, questions answered and behind‑the‑scenes stories from the Paizo team, and even full‑fledged gamer‑made expansions to the campaign!</p><section class=\"spotlight\"><aside><h3>Returning to Kingmaker</h3><p>The Kingmaker Adventure Path originally appeared in Pathfinder Adventure Path #31–36. While those who have played that version of the campaign will find familiar elements within these pages, much has changed. We’ve added to the beginning and ending, as well as expanding several adventure sites within the Stolen Lands. Some of these draw inspiration from Owlcat’s Pathfinder: Kingmaker computer game, while others are entirely new to this book. Many of these revisions were inspired by extensive player feedback on the <em><code>paizo.com</code></em> forums.</p><p>If you’re new to Kingmaker, now’s your chance to experience a campaign that became legendary, a full sandbox experience where your players can chart the course of their own nation!</p></aside><figure><img width=\"200\" src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker/assets/journal-kingdom/crown.webp\" /></figure></section><h2>RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN</h2><p>Kingmaker features a primary storyline summarized in the Campaign Synopsis section on the previous page, but there is no set path that the PCs must follow as the story unfolds. This type of campaign, known as a sandbox, brings specific challenges. The framework of the story— particularly the points at which NPCs make requests of the PCs—is meant to guide the players, but for large portions of the campaign, they’ll determine the direction the adventure actually takes. The more familiar you are with the contents of this book, the easier it will be for you to stay a step or two ahead of the PCs.</p><p>One of the primary difficulties in running a sandbox is that the locations the PCs choose to explore won’t necessarily hold challenges appropriate for their level; they can stumble into an encounter that’s well beyond their capabilities or one so easy that it’s no challenge at all. So, throughout this book, each encounter is assigned a numeric severity level equal to the character level that we expect most parties to be at when they encounter that content. When your party is heading into an encounter that’s above their level, consider giving them a bit of advance warning in the form of ominous clues, disturbing omens, or even something as obvious as having them find an old signpost with the words “DANGER AHEAD” scrawled on it. You can also use the NPCs they encounter along the way to guide them; friendly allies can warn the party of terrible threats near their intended destination or suggest reasons to explore more suitable locations instead. The map of the Stolen Lands breaks this campaign into 20 different zones; you can use the @UUID[JournalEntry.9PIQlzot3RTQio8U.JournalEntryPage.LCdukChAYoW5bXvO]{Stolen Lands Zones} table as a handy guide to determine how dangerous a region is before the PCs enter it.</p><p>Kingmaker offers many more possible encounters for each level than a party actually needs to advance in power. This means that some of the encounters might never occur in your game, and that’s fine! You can always save encounters or even entire dungeons for use in other campaigns. Certainly, a group who accomplishes every single encounter in this campaign will eventually outpace the challenges and find themselves reaching 20th level well before the campaign’s end. If you and your group are okay with this, that’s fine; it can be fun to blast through content with powerful characters, after all! If you want to spread things out, you can use the slow advancement speed as detailed on page 509 of the Core Rulebook so that the PCs will need to complete more encounters.</p><h3>Milestone or Experience?</h3><p>For a sandbox game like Kingmaker, story‑based leveling can be awkward since a big part of the fun of a sandbox campaign is the freedom to explore, get in over your head, retreat and build up power, then return for a rematch against a foe that was once too powerful. Without experience points to represent their progression through the game, players lack a method of tracking and anticipating when they’ll be gaining levels, and this can complicate play. If you decide to abandon XP and simply choose when the characters level up, it’s recommended that you use 19 specific milestones that, as the PCs complete them, provide excellent points for the party to level up. The @UUID[.CfMVHpKH8GljscF7]{Story Milestones} table lists 19 potential milestones, and can also help the GM visualize the expected progression of the party’s journey through this campaign.</p>"

The audio within these playlists primarily use assets provided by Owlcat Studios, for whom we are extremely grateful, and are augmented by audio assets from @UUID[JournalEntry.CVl4IXFSbmjCZ6fb.JournalEntryPage.swcgTlpn4FWgbqLe]{a few other important sources}.</p><p>To achieve the best sound experience with your players, please configure the user volume controls at the top of the playlist tab to 50% volume, and adjust only those sliders if the volume is too quiet or too loud. All audio was mixed under the assumption that these sliders will be placed at 50%.</p><p>When preparing for your Kingmaker sessions, it is always beneficial to run through the audio playlists so that you have an understanding of the sound environment provided by each playlist you will use.</p><p>Playlists for Kingmaker primarily use the \"Simultaneous Playback\" option, allowing GMs to hit one button to play all of the audio for a particular area. It is recommended when the players transition from one area to another to check for a named playlist for the new area and simultaneously click play on one playlist while hitting stop on the current playlist (there is a 6 second fade in/fade out on each playlist), this should provide a smooth, cross-fading audio experience for your players.</p><section class=\"fvtt\"><header><h4>Playlist Organization</h4></header><p>In order to make the playlists easier to follow, each playlist has been titled to match the journal entry it is intended to correspond to. The only exception to this rule is cases where a combat encounter with a major NPC is 'optional' or where there is a story event which takes place in the same location before the combat occurs— playlists which only have the name of the NPC or encounter are intended to be used for the combat or dramatic event.</p><p>For example, @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR]{1. A Call for Heroes} begins with @UUID[JournalEntry.LLqpAfJTEvqiwQiR.JournalEntryPage.bARm1CFX7iVxAKDr]{Part 1. The Swordlord's Feast} journal entry, and its accompanying playlist @UUID[Playlist.r1c45gZoJEa3Msiz]{Swordlord's Feast (Aldori Hall)} should be played when introducing the players as the feast begins at the opening of the game.</p><header><h4>Stings and Themes</h4></header><p>The audio design for Kingmaker includes separate playlists for Stings and Themes.</p><p><strong>Stings</strong> are short (~30s) music clips designed to provide small musical prompts to the players that something important has occurred related to a particular NPC, Plotline, or Event. You might play @UUID[Playlist.KBHapDWEEaAhEMvf.PlaylistSound.0UoFa7rmk1l83jwI]{Hand of Nyrissa} when the players first encounter her or something she has done as part of the adventure's plot. Or use @UUID[Playlist.KBHapDWEEaAhEMvf.PlaylistSound.BCoab0Zb0Bn6mLsA]{Tartuccio} to hint that something relates to Tartuccio's underhanded actions.</p><p>We have also included a number of stings for battles and events to accent player victories and accomplishments.</p><p><strong>Themes</strong> are longer, seamlessly looping, musical pieces which are intended to be used during dramatic events. The goal of the themes playlist is to allow GMs to hint to players that there is some involvement of a particular faction, dramatic event, or major NPC. In addition, a number of themes are included to be used during scenes that should have a particular emotion.</p><p>For example, if your party has encountered an NPC they shouldn't take too seriously, you might play @UUID[Playlist.J38Fr6oATUjitviT.PlaylistSound.8hF0fkR9CUEg8nbH]{Bold Dog Barks Loud} or @UUID[Playlist.J38Fr6oATUjitviT.PlaylistSound.xsEk3JygPi9GcW0w]{Light Comedy}. While if your players have been doing well leading their kingdom in a positive, friendly, kind direction you might reward them during a round of Kingdom Management with @UUID[Playlist.J38Fr6oATUjitviT.PlaylistSound.iF5T9MO5TsCuKGRf]{Rule Of Good} .</p><header><h4>Soundboards</h4></header><p>We have included a number of soundboard-only playlists which contain an array of sound effects intended to be triggered at GM discretion to enhance the sound environments of a scene or event. The purpose of these sounds and soundboards should be self explanatory based on the name of each sound.</p><p>For example, the Environmental Loops playlist can be leveraged by a GM to add weather sounds to an existing scene's playlist. If the players are visiting one of their lumber camps, you might enhance the scene by playing @UUID[Playlist.f8WaMOSx9YWW5szP.PlaylistSound.cp2paSPWJjpBmN8r]{Timber And Axes}. If the weather turns foul while they are making camp for the night, you might play @UUID[Playlist.f8WaMOSx9YWW5szP.PlaylistSound.OyC9dJvfBB8CsaXA]{Thunderstorm} to add to that feeling.</p><p></p></section>",

If you aren’t human, you were adopted by one of Brevoy’s nobles or were perhaps a favored servant or even a childhood friend of a noble scion. Whatever the case, you’ve had a comfortable life, though still a far cry from the one your distant cousins or close associates know.

Yet you have no substantive proof of your nobility, and you’ve learned that claiming such without evidence is a fool’s game.

You take a –1 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks attempted when dealing with members of the nobility, but gain the Haughty Obstinacy human ancestry feat, even if you aren’t a human.

You come from hardy stock and were raised with simple sensibilities—that hard work earns well-deserved gains, the importance of charity and compassion, and the value of personal and familial honor. Yours is the country of the Aldori swordlords and the heroes who refused to bend before the armies of a violent conqueror. You care little for matters of politics and nobles or of deception and schemes. You are thoroughly Brevic, and the call for champions willing to expand your land’s influence into the Stolen Lands has inflamed your sense of patriotism and honor, and so you have joined an expedition to journey southward and build a kingdom.</p><hr /><p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong>: Strength or Constitution, free ability boost.</p><p>You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Farming Lore skill.

                            "text": "<p>Amid the constant threat of civil war, the inhabitants of Brevoy have more pressing concerns than their neighbors’ ancestries, and few judge anyone by that alone. Brevans value custom and loyalty; thus, anyone who adheres to local traditions enjoys a high degree of tolerance and acceptance. As such, the region boasts a diverse population.</p><p>Characters don’t have to be from Brevoy to play the Kingmaker Adventure Path, but since the campaign begins as the party receives a charter from the swordlords of Restov, and the initial approach into the Stolen Lands is from Brevoy, players should consider how members of their character’s ancestry and class function in this northern kingdom.</p><p>The common ancestries from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> all work seamlessly with Kingmaker. If a player is considering a rare or uncommon ancestry from another source, the GM should consider challenges and opportunities the story and setting may present for that character, as highlighted below.</p><h3>Thematic Ancestries</h3><p>Groups of antagonistic kobolds and lizardfolk reside in the Stolen Lands, so players who make characters with these ancestries may have to make difficult choices. Alternately, the presence of such a PC can, at the GM’s discretion, make alliances with these groups more likely.</p><p>With Kingmaker’s thematic ties to the First World, a leshy character could be a fun player option. Likewise, a sprite character might find themselves faced with unexpected advantages or disadvantages in portions of this adventure where the First World has a stronger role. It’s best for a sprite PC to have no knowledge of the Adventure Path’s key villains and very limited knowledge of the First World; a sprite who has lived their whole life on the Material Plane works better in Kingmaker than one who is more familiar with the First World’s strangeness.</p><p>The proximity of Numeria to the Stolen Lands also makes it likely that some androids and ratfolk have drifted east into the region.</p><h3>Unaffiliated Ancestries</h3><p>Hobgoblins, along with many of the versatile heritages such as those touched by the planes or beastkin, aren’t that common in the region, but neither are they unknown or as unexpected as something like catfolk or tengu. And unlike lizardfolk or kobolds, most in the Stolen Lands don’t hold a bias against these ancestries, and they make relatively safe, low-impact options for PCs in Kingmaker. (For a PC with a versatile heritage such as changeling, dhampir, or one of the planar scions, their primary ancestry will also impact how well they fit in Kingmaker.) While azarketi would also fit this category, the lack of opportunities to excel in underwater or aquatic environments makes them a particularly poor choice for this campaign.</p><h3>Unusual Ancestries</h3><p>Catfolk, fetchlings, fleshwarps, kitsune, strix, and tengu are not well-known in the Stolen Lands; if players choose from these options, they may often be regarded as unusual or curious visitors by denizens in the River Kingdoms. GMs might want to play up some NPCs’ reactions to characters of unexpected ancestries, or consider altering some NPC ancestries to match those characters—if only to help explain why some people in the Stolen Lands know that a catfolk isn’t a werecreature!</p>"

These rules don’t work particularly well when an army attacks a single target—such encounters are better played out with the PCs facing the threat themselves.</p><p>But what if the PCs want to fight with their soldiers on the field of battle? For the most part, a PC who fights in an army won’t noticeably affect that army’s stats. Having a famous (or infamous) founder of the kingdom fighting at your side in battle can bolster an army’s mindset, though, so if a PC chooses to fight in this way, they grant a +1 status bonus to that army’s Morale checks.</p><p>A better way to incorporate PCs in battles is to have them confront specific singular enemies on the field of battle while the armies themselves fight it out all around them. In such a case, play out the war encounter to its completion to determine the degree of success achieved (see Victory or Defeat in @UUID[.Sz7W36dIfOpzuRth]{War Encounters}, then play out the battle between the PCs and their foe(s). If the PCs win this battle, the result of the war encounter is improved one degree, but if the PCs lose their battle or the enemy escapes, the result of the war encounter is worsened one degree.</p><h3>Powerful Magic</h3><p>Some spells and magic items, particularly at higher levels, could potentially have significant effects on the outcome of mass conflict. For example, a fireball can burn many targets at once. Earthquake can not only destroy large portions of a battlefield, but they can potentially devastate entire armies. And powerful monsters like dragons can simply fly above an army and rain down devastation in the form of breath weapons. The rules presented here do not allow for this level of interaction between individual characters and full-scale armies, but you can allow it if you wish.</p><p>In cases where the PCs wish to use powerful magic to help resolve potential war encounters, feel free to let them automatically defeat armies that are 5 levels or more lower than the party’s level—this represents the PCs using their resources to defeat trivial foes, and the PCs shouldn’t earn XP for such a tactic. Of course, most of the armies the PCs encounter in this adventure will be close to their own levels, so such methods aren’t appropriate. In these cases, the easiest solution is to simply give the PCs a +1 to +2 circumstance bonus to any war encounter checks they make to represent the advantage they have using this magic. Alternately, powerful spells can simply alter the landscape of the battlefield—see @UUID[.rhaj7QWAk7jbONA3]{Battlefield Terrain Features} on for more details.</p><p>Note that if you allow the PCs to do this, consider allowing NPC enemies the same for their forces as you see fit.</p><aside><h3>Traveling with an Army</h3><p>Normally, armies move through the Stolen Lands during Kingdom turns via the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.ysKkyZp02RMujObE]{Deploy Army} activity, but if the PCs wish to travel with armies during hexploration—a particularly wise choice during the War of the River Kings—they can do so. In this case, when the PCs come across a non-army encounter, assume the PCs’ forces hang back while the PCs play out the encounter in encounter mode as usual. When the PCs encounter an army, they can engage it with their own army in a war encounter. If the PCs leave an army during hexploration, that army remains in its hex until the PCs return to guide it in hexploration mode again or until they move it with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.ysKkyZp02RMujObE]{Deploy Army} activity during a Kingdom turn.</p></aside>",

What does matter is relative position between armies. During a war encounter, armies can be in one of the following three relative positions. Two of these positions—engaged and distant—are also @UUID[.3sgmiSFT7UVikm6s]{conditions}.</p><p><strong>Near</strong>: When war encounters begin, the armies involved are normally considered near—close enough to advance and engage with a foe, but far enough to avoid direct conflict. An army cannot attempt melee Strikes against an enemy that is near—only ranged Strikes. Indicate an army is near by placing its token on the grid in any square not adjacent to another army.</p><p><strong>Engaged</strong>: An army that is engaged can attempt melee Strikes against other armies it is engaged with. Indicate armies that are engaged with each other by placing their tokens adjacent to one another. An army can be engaged with up to four armies at once.</p><p><strong>Distant</strong>: An army that attempts to disengage or retreat can move to a distant point on the battlefield. Attacks on a distant army are possible via ranged Strikes, but at a –5 penalty for the range. Indicate a distant army’s position by placing its token or miniature on the table just off the edge of the grid. (Armies that manage to flee the battle entirely are taken off the table.)</p><h3>Battlefield Terrain Features</h3><p>While some battles take place in open terrain, some battlefields contain additional terrain features. Relatively common battlefield terrain features are detailed below; some of the scripted war encounters in the Adventure Path feature other, specific terrain features.</p><p><strong>Darkness or Heavy Fog</strong>: All armies become concealed, and distant armies become undetected. Armies in these conditions take a –4 circumstance penalty on Scouting checks. Armies with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.y1JGtzGmMtVh5USK]{darkvision} ignore the terrain effects of darkness.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: A war encounter that takes place in rugged mountains, swampland, or dense forests are examples of difficult battlefield terrain. Armies take a –2 circumstance penalty on Maneuver checks in difficult terrain.</p><p><strong>Dim Light, Light Fog, or Rain</strong>: Armies in these conditions gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Maneuver checks and take a –2 circumstance penalty on Scouting checks. Distant armies become concealed. Armies with low-light vision or darkvision ignore the terrain effects of dim light.</p><p><strong>Wind</strong>: Ranged Strikes take a –1 circumstance penalty in strong wind, or a –2 circumstance penalty in windstorms. The penalty for a ranged Strike on a distant army is doubled to –10 (this penalty stacks with the standard penalty to ranged Strikes in wind).</p><h3>Fortifications</h3><p>Some battlefields include a fortification (such as a keep, castle, wall, or trench) that can house one or more armies. An army can’t seek defense in a fortification once a battle begins; it must prepare itself and its defenses in advance during a @UUID[.kwEHLYvBIECJ2xkX]{Kingdom turn} via the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.kingmaker-features.Item.iYLFBep0kddHQkW9]{Garrison Army} activity.

In the eerie ruin of Hask‑Ultharan, the “Cairn of Many Torments,” something ancient stirs to a perverse new life, awakened by the magic of the oculus of Abaddon at the hands of the cyclops lich Vordakai.

But do the lawless lords of that wild country actually seek to invite a new ruler into their midst, or is this meeting of merciless despots merely a stage for assassination and warlike aspirations?

Can the PCs defend their nation from their own fatherland? And will their act of defiance stoke the flames of revolution in Brevoy?</p><h3>VENGEANCE OF THE FALLEN</h3><p>During the course of this campaign, the PCs faced numerous enemies. As events play out in your game, keep track of those enemies who escape, as these can provide you with exciting opportunities for future adventures. What better hook for a new generation of PCs than to face off against a Stag Lord, a troll king, or an ageless barbarian warlord returned to seek vengeance against the kingdom whose rulers defeated them once before?</p>"

They may even be content to rule this “kingdom in a bottle,” but the knowledge that they are nothing more than a glowing grain of sand in a chalice may soon drive them to seek a way to escape. In time, the Lantern King forgives Nyrissa and allows the thousand kingdoms she’s captured to transform into her new realm in the First World—but the time between the PCs’ kingdom being absorbed into the Apology and this event is flexible, and how it changes their reality is left for you to decide.</p><p>Alternatively, the PCs could be left behind when their kingdom is taken. If this occurs, the region known as the Stolen Lands is immediately transformed into a lifeless desert—the rivers that once flowed through the region are quickly absorbed by the thirsty sands. This event causes much panic in neighboring kingdoms— particularly Brevoy and Pitax, whose borders now lie uncomfortably close to a wasteland.</p><p>The method by which the Stolen Lands can be restored is up to you, but it likely requires a journey into the First World, perhaps even the attention of the Eldest.

The guthallath’s erosion aura could be caused by clouds of deconstructor nanites and its annihilation beams manifest as plasma blasts. The adamantine golem might have tank treads instead of legs and its vent ability might manifest as a spray of dozens of laser beams in a cone.

All of these constructs have weakness 15 to critical hits and electricity, but their other statistics do not change.

This vilderavn serves the Lantern King, who sent them to Thousand Voices to observe Nyrissa’s growing influence. They land before the PCs and, pretending to serve Nyrissa, imperiously demand to know why the PCs have intruded upon Thousand Voices. Of course, they know well who the PCs are by reputation, unless they’ve taken pains to disguise themselves—the vilderavn wants the PCs to succeed at building their kingdom so Nyrissa can absorb it and thus complete her apology to their master, the Lantern King; the vilderavn, of course, reveals none of this to the party. Instead, they encourage the PCs to “return to their realm and see to its needs; this woodland is not yours for the taking.” The vilderavn attacks if attacked first, or if the PCs refuse to turn back and leave the forest behind. If combat breaks out, the vilderavn and their zomok mount work to drive the PCs out or incapacitate them rather than kill them; they want the PCs to survive and finish building their kingdom, after all! Only one of these emissaries patrols the forest; if they are slain, this encounter won’t occur again. Likewise, once Chapter 10 begins and Nyrissa has started the process of absorbing the PCs’ kingdom, the emissary’s role here is no longer needed—in this case, this encounter is with the wild hunt instead.</p><p><strong>Wild Hunt.</strong> An encounter with the wild hunt in Thousand Voices is with a pair of wild hunt archers (page 618) accompanied by four wild hunt hounds (page 616).

If war with Pitax has begun, they’ll attack the PCs on sight. Otherwise, they’ll interrogate the PCs about their purpose in the region; depending on the answers, they’ll either let them move on, escort them out of the region back to Drelev, or attack.
