            "description": "<p><em>test1test2Chochori are amphibious coral people who have a complex culture with their own unique social groupings, life cycle, and way of looking at the world, distinct from other ancestries.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>In chochori society, there are as many myths, legends, and tales of the ancestry&rsquo;s birth as there are storytellers with willing audiences, with few common themes. Were chochori created by the balance&rsquo;s deity of water? Or perhaps they are older than the Balance itself, the children of a powerful and ancient water eldamon. While their earliest history is shrouded in mystery, chochori keep excellent records of what has come after, making their undersea libraries inscribed into shell or other durable materials the envy of other aquatic civilizations. The name chochori comes from the chochori word \"cho,\" meaning all, and \"chori.\" \"Chori\" is the plural of the singular \"chora,\" indicating a subdivision of chochori with a nuanced meaning that is difficult to translate into a single word.</p>\n<p>While each chochori is an individual, a chochori&rsquo;s body is made up of a network of nearly identical polyps, with subtle differences that allow them to perform specialized tasks. Because of this plural nature, as a being composed of multiple interconnected selves working in harmony, chochori are more likely than most ancestries to be plural, a system of individuals sharing the same body. That&rsquo;s not to say that all chochori are plural; it&rsquo;s quite common to see chochori who aren&rsquo;t plural, as well as those of all points on the plurality spectrum, including medians, multiples, and more.</p>\n<p>However, chochori don&rsquo;t have a concept of sex or gender, and they have extreme trouble understanding what either of these mean for other ancestries or why they are significant. Especially difficult for chochori are two tasks: they are supposed to tell beings of various genders apart (g&rsquo;mayuns or orpoks look the same to chochori; other than being able to distinguish individuals, they don&rsquo;t really notice any broader trends) and the use of gendered language, especially in languages that use gender excessively and assign them even to inanimate objects and articles. This is because chochori don&rsquo;t have a gender or sex (some members of other ancestries claim that they do, but that they have a single sex, but most chochori themselves disagree, and thus most people take them at their word). Instead, chochori reproduce in one of two ways: via budding, which creates a child with many similarities to their single parent, or by spawning, where multiple chochori release polyps into the water and some combination of them mix and form infant chochori. Children after a spawning ceremony are raised communally by the chochori community and, unlike chochori born from budding, they are considered to be children of all, rather than any specific parent or parents. In most cases, it would take significant divination magic to even figure out which polyps combined to form the young chochori, and chochori would find such an intrusion offensive, especially if it came with an attempt to claim parentage or some special connection.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character made of coral with an amphibious lifestyle and a distinctive way of looking at the world, you should play a chochori.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Express a deep curiosity about the stories and mysteries of the world around you.</li>\n<li>Find it difficult to understand certain things that other ancestries take for granted.</li>\n<li>Look at everything and everyone around you through the lens of what their chora might be.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ascribe values or characteristics to you that fit their own conception of what other ancestries are like.</li>\n<li>Assume that you are focused only on the world beneath the waves.</li>\n<li>Consider you knowledgeable about the oceans and all of their legends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Chochori are beings of living coral formed into roughly humanoid shapes. Every polyp making up a chochori&rsquo;s body is a separate but extremely similar component, with different physical features as necessary to serve as part of the chochori&rsquo;s collective body. In this way, they are a single living being made up of a colony of individual components. Those who study chochori biology in a cursory fashion and learn this fact sometimes try to stare at chochori to see if they can find some kind of \"seams\" or \"divisions\" between the chochori&rsquo;s different polyps, but they are all connected so seamlessly that it is incredibly difficult to detect with the naked eye.</p>\n<p>Chochori adorn and offer to do the same to others for whom they hold affection with all sorts of colorful marine objects (and sometimes even tiny creatures), in a style that makes them look almost like a living coral reef. Chochori tend to add to their adornments as they accomplish deeds, and others who care for them gift them adornments in similar circumstances. This can cause a truly accomplished chochori to have an extremely colorful and eclectic look. Furthermore, some members of other ancestries don&rsquo;t understand where the coral body of a chochori ends and the ornamentation begins, leading them to misunderstand the chochori&rsquo;s true appearance or even causing them to be unable to recognize an extremely familiar chochori with their ornamentation removed or significantly increased. Chochori with a parent, those born from budding rather than spawning, have a deep physical similarity to their parent, but due to the ornamentation, they often have a visual appearance so distinctive that no chochori would confuse them. However, a chochori who intentionally created or pilfered adornments with the explicit purpose of impersonating their parent would have a particularly easy time fooling an onlooker&rsquo;s eyes.</p>\n<h2>Chochori Adventurers</h2>\n<p>A chochori&rsquo;s chora has a major influence on whether a chochori is likely to become an adventurer, and what kind of adventurer they might become. For instance, aikrys gravitate towards being alchemists or inventors in order to make use of their ingenuity, while farose are more likely to become champions, barbarians, warrior bards, or other characters who demonstrate courage, passion, or leadership. Chochori of any chora might become clerics, druids, or other religious figures, especially among the Eld where worship is led by a council with one member from each chora. However, even in those classes, hypisks are more common than the other chori. Among chochori, typical backgrounds vary by chora as well. Some popular backgrounds include acolyte, animal whisperer, artist, emissary, entertainer, hunter, scholar, scout, tinker, and warrior.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Chochori society is built around many different dichotomies and tends toward a societal structure they call a choriste, which surface ancestries consider somewhat similar to a \"chiefdom,\" in that it&rsquo;s a mostly collective culture that also includes a small number of hereditary leaders, or a \"clan,\" in that most or all members bear a relationship with each other by lineage. Chochori leaders are the descendants of chochori heroes. Any kind of hero can become a chochori leader, but often those who have hereditary magical or physical gifts, such as sorcerers, have the longest-lived line of leaders. This is because chochori leaders typically reproduce via budding, asexual reproduction with a single parent, passing the mantle of hero-leader on from parent to child. Sometimes old heroic lines die off, and new heroes are born to take their place. Most other chochori reproduce nearly exclusively via spawning, releasing tiny polyps into a common area where they recombine together and form new young chochori. These young chochori born from spawning are raised communally by the chochori settlement or group as a whole, and they don&rsquo;t consider any particular chochori to be more their \"parents\" than any others. Chochori other than leaders sometimes also reproduce via budding for various reasons, but chochori society considers such a thing unusual and potentially self-absorbed.</p>\n<p>Chochori divide themselves into seven chori, subdivisions that most other ancestries find as mystifying as chochori themselves find the alien idea of \"gender.\" Chochori find chori to be perfectly natural and effortlessly subdivide animals, plants, objects, and even members of other ancestries into chori as well. Learning their language (also called Chochori) is incredibly difficult for creatures who can&rsquo;t either instinctively classify things based on chori or carefully memorize predetermined lists of classifications, since adjectives are conjugated based on the chori of the noun they modify, and verbs are conjugated based on the chori of both the subject and the object (for reflexive verbs, the conjugation is the same as when the subject and the object both come from the same chora).</p>\n<p>Chori defy easy classification with a single word in Common. A chora is clearly not a social \"class\" within chochori society, as chochori of every chora can hold any status and occupation. Members of any chora can become a hero and thus a leader. They bear no resemblance to other ancestries&rsquo; concepts of subdivisions such as ethnicity, and indeed, while a budded chochori child often has the same chora as their sole parent, that isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s possible for a chochori&rsquo;s chora to change during their lifetime, potentially multiple times. This experience is more likely in a chochori who is a gateway system than in a closed system, since gateway systems can have new members enter the system, and the new members might influence the chochori&rsquo;s chora. Chochori don&rsquo;t seem to care that other ancestries can&rsquo;t find a way to classify chori, to them chori are just chori. However, sociologists from other ancestries, desperate to come up with some explanation, have tried to describe them as being more similar to genders than they are to either social classes or ethnicities, in that they are a part of one&rsquo;s identity that is internal rather than being based on heritage or occupation. Even those sociologists realize how much of a stretch this is, and admit that chori are still utterly different from genders and share virtually no similarities, they are the closest concept that they could envision to associate them with. Chochori sociologists, for their part, just see this as another in the endless examples of other ancestries&rsquo; obsession with gender and sex. The following are the seven chori.</p>\n<h3>Aikrys</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the aikrys chora tend to be especially independent, ingenious, and innovative. This makes them likelier than chochori of other chori to be lone pioneers in various fields, especially when it comes to inventing new things or discovering new places. They can be somewhat temperamental and are not always in control of their emotions. The aikrys chora is associated with the element of air, and it is said that a great aikrys hero long ago first discovered that the world of air up above the water&rsquo;s surface was safe for chochori, back in ancient times when it was believed that the surface was the edge of the known world, leading to the underworld or a dangerous otherworld. Aikrys chochori are respected for their ingenuity, but they sometimes innovate and iterate even when the old way of doing things was perfectly serviceable, and sometimes their experiments end in utter failure. That&rsquo;s not to say aikrys chochori act like reckless scientists, with laboratories of exploding prototypes. It&rsquo;s simply the case that it usually takes learning from multiple failed attempts to successfully innovate. Aikrys chochori are among the most common to become adventurers, inventors, and scientists, due to their independent streak and sense of exploration.</p>\n<h3>Carbor</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the carbor chora tend to grow in a way that&rsquo;s deeply intertwined with others. Their interconnectedness can make them sympathetic to others&rsquo; feelings, and their way of considering others&rsquo; feelings and motivations can also make them talented at persuasion. Carbor chochori can be extremely loyal to those close to them, though they are suspicious and slow to trust when it comes to strangers. However, once they accept someone, they quickly grow closer. The carbor chora is associated with the element of wood, and it is said that a great carbor hero long ago helped set up the structures of the first choristes. Carbor chochori are well-regarded for their ability to understand and get along with others, though other chochori make sure to be open and upfront with carbor chochori in order to prove their honesty and allay the carbor chochori&rsquo;s suspicion. In groups where cohesion and teamwork is crucial, such as hunting parties, diplomatic envoys, or adventuring groups, carbor chochori excel as members, so long as they have time to warm up to the group before a high-stakes mission.</p>\n<h3>Farose</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the farose chora tend to be courageous and confident. That&rsquo;s not to say they never feel any sort of doubt or fear, or that they act recklessly. It simply means they are able to continue onward in the face of such fears and doubts with exceptional resolve. They can be enthusiastic in the pursuit of their passions and goals, which is generally a good thing, but can make them impatient when a goal is delayed, especially by delays they feel are unnecessary or pointless. Their brave and decisive attitude can also be seen as aggressive. The farose chora is associated with the element of fire, and it is said that a great farose hero long ago fought back terrifying ancient evils that arose from deep under the sea, ensuring the safety of their homeland. Farose chochori are lauded for their bravery and leadership, but sometimes viewed with anxiety for their tendency towards impatient, aggressive, and occasionally rash solutions to obstacles in their path. No one wants to be seen as an obstacle to a farose chochori. Farose chochori have a tendency to volunteer for fast-paced and dangerous tasks that other chochori would balk at facing. This also includes violent professions such as soldiers or adventurers. They often find roles allowing for leadership or decision-making easier to handle than those where they might have to wait and stew for a decision to be made.</p>\n<h3>Hypisk</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the hypisk chora tend to be gentle and artistic, with a calm eye towards the bigger picture and the inner beauty hidden within everyday things. They often have a rich inner world, with deep and expressive dreams. The hypisk chora is associated with the element of water, and it is said that a great hypisk hero long ago had prophetic dreams that led the people of that time to discover rich lands of plenty in which to live and build their settlements. Hypisk chochori are seen as wise for their ability to understand the larger context of things and look past the surface level. However, due to their inner contemplations, they are sometimes seen as reserved or distant, almost as if they&rsquo;re looking past you or through you. Still, they tend to be as sociable as most other chori, so they don&rsquo;t have a reputation for being shy, as vergiss chochori do. Hypisk chochori excel at artistic and creative tasks or those that require deeper reflection and wisdom. They are less likely than chochori of most other chori to become adventurers or other violent occupations.</p>\n<h3>Jamambri</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the jamambri chora tend to be quick- thinking and adaptable, able to react extremely quickly and effectively to all sorts of unusual situations. They are often extremely curious, which, when combined with their quick thinking, means that they flit about from curiosity to curiosity, enjoying each one until their inquisitive nature inspires their interest in something else. The jamambri chora is associated with the element of electricity (chochori see electricity as an element, as it is one of the elements in the ancient religion known as the Eld), and it is said that a great jamambri hero long ago was the first to react when chochori of that era met other ancestries, adapting to their strange ways and obsession with incomprehensible concepts like sex and gender. Jamambri chochori are seen as particularly cunning and able to land on their feet in any situation. However, they can also be seen as fickle, mercurial, and flighty due to their ever-changing interests. Jamambri chochori often change their occupation many times throughout their lives, and they try a little bit of everything at least once, except for jobs that require mindless repetition or labor. Jobs with a large number of disparate, quickly-changing tasks or challenges, such as adventuring, are especially popular among jamambri chochori.</p>\n<h3>Terath</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the terath chora tend to be patient and equanimous, willing to bide their time and take things slowly if necessary. They are more likely to place extreme value on a promise and oath and to always keep their word. Terath chochori&rsquo;s patience contrasts with both farose chochori&rsquo;s impatience and jamambri chochori&rsquo;s short attention spans. This doesn&rsquo;t lead to any antagonism between terath chochori and those of the other two chori, however. Instead, it allows them to work together well, with each lending their strengths to cover the other&rsquo;s weaknesses. For instance, most terath chochori appreciate the quick thinking of jamambri chochori, while for their part, the majority of jamambri chochori are all too happy to have someone else who is not just willing but eager to perform slow-paced and repetitive work. The terath chora is associated with the element of earth, and it is said that a great terath hero long ago discovered aquaculture, allowing chochori to have a steady, consistent food source through low, careful planning, rather than being subject to the whims of a poor hunting season. Terath chochori are seen as exceptionally reliable due to their tendency to remain calm and patient, and to always keep their promises, even if it requires great persistence to do so. However, their stalwart refusal to back down can sometimes give them a reputation for being stubborn. Once a terath chochori has made a decision, their tendency to stick to it no matter what can be either a virtue or a vice, depending on the situation. Terath chochori often prefer jobs where they can take their time and get everything perfect, rather than those where they have to make split-second decisions or otherwise act extremely quickly.</p>\n<h3>Vergiss</h3>\n<p>Chochori of the vergiss chora tend to be analytical and practical, looking at problems from various different perspectives and logically breaking them down into smaller problems in order to solve them. They tend to take things seriously and to keep to themselves, able to relate more easily to logic, mathematics, and other things that follow expected patterns than they are to other people, with their unpredictable moods and whims. The vergiss chora is associated with the element of ice (chochori see ice as an element, as it is one of the elements associated with the ancient religion known as the Eld), and it is said that a great vergiss hero long ago developed the complex mathematics that chochori have used across the ages to research physics and other advanced topics. Vergiss chochori are seen as serious and intellectual and are respected for their logical way of thinking. However, they are often also viewed as shy or introverted. Chochori of other chori might approach a vergiss chochori cautiously and politely when starting a conversation without a predetermined structure for the socialization, out of respect for what they guess to be the vergiss chochori&rsquo;s preferences. Vergiss chochori aren&rsquo;t usually quick to blame others either way. However, while they tend to judge others with exceptional grace and consideration, when it comes to themselves they often hold impossibly high standards, leading them to be extremely self-critical at times. Vergiss chochori&rsquo;s tendency to be introverted doesn&rsquo;t mean that they prefer to work alone, though that&rsquo;s true for some vergiss chochori. Most, however, enjoy working with others nearby as long as the other people are also quietly working and leave them alone with their thoughts so they can concentrate on their own work. They prefer tasks involving intellect, logic, and rationality. This sometimes leads to occupations that are similar to those preferred by aikrys chochori, but while an aikrys scientist is more likely to pioneer a novel research field, a vergiss scientist will usually be the one methodically and logically filling in the conceptual holes left behind during the aikrys chochori&rsquo;s rush to innovate something new.</p>\n<h2>Chochori Settlements</h2>\n<p>Chochori settlements tend to be relatively small by the standards of ancestries that build giant metropolises, though chochori see those other ancestries as building settlements that are pointlessly large. Typically, new settlements are formed after the advent of a new chochori hero or heroes, and their lines become the settlement&rsquo;s new leaders. Chochori settlements are places of great learning under the sea, and they are often sought out by other aquatic or amphibious ancestries seeking old tales or new ideas alike.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Chochori tend to have a complicated relationship with alignment that leads to them tending more towards neutral, or alignments at most one step from neutral. This is especially true for chochori who are systems, as the varying perspectives of the differing members of the system make it less likely for the chochori to settle on one of the more extreme alignments. Some of the different chori have mild tendencies towards law or chaos. Aikrys, farose, and jamambri are slightly more likely to be chaotic, and carbor, terath, and vergiss are slightly more likely to be lawful. Hypisk don&rsquo;t tend either way.</p>\n<p>While many chochori worship any of the various deities of the balance, much like the other ancestries of the Indigo Isles, a significant number of chochori still worship the ancient elemental religion known as the Eld, which predates the coming of the gods of the Balance to Alacar. Chochori adherents of the Eld consider the seven chori to be manifestations of the Eld and its various different elements, and they tend towards religious structures involving councils of seven high priests, one from each chora.</p>\n<h2>The Eld</h2>\n<p>Chochori are hardly the only people on Alacar who worship the ancient pre-balance religion called the Eld, but they&rsquo;re among the more prominent followers in the area around the Indigo Isles, alongside kragraks and some of the various heritages of dragons.</p>\n<p>The Eld holds that the world was created from far more inherent elements than the classical few elements on which other elemental traditions focus, with as many as twenty interconnected elements. Rather than anthropomorphic deities, adherents of the Eld venerate the elements themselves, as well as the elemental monsters born of the Eld (sometimes known as eldamon) as their representatives, akin to the role of saints or angels in other religions.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Chochori names tend to be simple and to the point. They almost always contain one letter from their chora in the Chochori alphabet, which is added when they determine their chora during an early coming of age ceremony. It&rsquo;s important to note that some sounds that use two letters in other alphabets, like the \"th\" in Terath or the \"ch\" in cho and chora, are a single letter in the Chochori alphabet. When a chochori changes their chora, they also change the letter they added to one from the new chora, unless the letter was present in both chori.</p>\n<p>However, chochori generally don&rsquo;t share their personal name except with those they deeply trust, and it&rsquo;s a sign of deep intimacy in chochori culture to do so. Instead, they give acquaintances or new people they&rsquo;ve just met an accomplishment name based on their profession or lifestyle, generally based on the most difficult challenge they have ever overcome. For example, a hunter who hunted the seaworm Ripplefang as their mightiest prey might gain the hunter-name Ripplefang, or Seaworm, while a mathematician whose greatest accomplishment was writing a proof that solved the Paradox of Arrows might take the mathematician-name Arrows, Paradox, or Paradox of Arrows. On the other hand, a diplomat whose most impressive achievement was to negotiate the Treaty of Oyster&rsquo;s Rest could have the diplomat- name Treaty of Oyster&rsquo;s Rest.</p>\n<h3>Sample Personal Names</h3>\n<p>Avar, Belkri, Erpo, Intha, Lofa, Osmo, Pivo</p>\n<h3>Sample Accomplishment Names</h3>\n<p>Banquet of Kings, Concert of the Flowing Tides, Law of Viscosity, Longjaw, Paradox of Arrows, Ripplefang, Treaty of Oyster&rsquo;s Rest</p>\n<h2>Chochori Heritages</h2>\n<p>Chochori have distinctive features based on the polyp or polyps from which they are born, completely distinct from the chora they will identify as their own later in life.</p>"

            "description": "<p><em>鹦鹉人是外形如同热带鸟的类人生物，一度从恶魔的腐化中解放，然而其内心仍在希望与诱惑之歌的争斗间挣扎不已。</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>很久以前，在鹦鹉人称为玫瑰之年（Age of Roses）的时代，许多鹦鹉人献身于艺术、音乐的创作，以此为春日、爱与音乐之神奇拉（Chira）服务。在玫瑰之年，鹦鹉人逐渐相信他们被一首伟大神曲（The Great Song）联系在一起，这首神曲如一幅多姿多彩的音乐绘卷，描绘了无数社区、友人、爱人与家庭间交织的联系。</p>\n<p>眼前的黄金时代似乎永远不会结束。在这种确信下，鹦鹉人逐渐满足于他们田园牧歌的生活方式。不幸的是，和平如此脆弱，美梦从不长久，玫瑰之年的鹦鹉人所享有的纯真无邪也似乎总有结束的一天。玫瑰之年很快迎来终结。</p>\n<p>鹦鹉人和他们的伟大神曲吸引了一群善妒而狠毒的恶魔的注意，这种注意很快转变成怨恨。恶魔们的目标是亵渎并扭曲鹦鹉人，让他们变成如恶魔们一般邪恶而残酷的生物。堕落开始的缓慢而温和，邪恶的种子撒播进各种各样的鹦鹉人社区。恶魔们将钩子深深扎入伟大神曲之中，鹦鹉人生命中的音乐与色彩登时错误百出、和谐不再。这时所有鹦鹉人都意识到一些卑鄙的阴谋正在发生，但要从恶魔们的计划中脱身，为时已晚。</p>\n<p>从缓慢的侵蚀到暴力入侵，鹦鹉人社会在恶魔的影响下堕落，玫瑰之年随之结束，怪物之年（Age of Monsters）正式开始。在堕落的伟大神曲影响下，鹦鹉人变得更加易怒，横跨数个世纪的经历让这个种族即将到达难以回头的极限，一旦如此，鹦鹉人与恶魔便没有什么不同，整个族裔都将被深渊吞噬，形似鹦鹉的新种恶魔则取其代之。</p>\n<p>在一切变得太晚之前，奇迹将鹦鹉人文明从灾难边缘拉了回来。即使过去这么久，奇拉——鹦鹉人的庇护女神没有放弃他们。不愿将她亲爱的追随者们完全交给罪恶的女神伸出援助之手，一道饱含欢乐与幸福的彩虹涌入伟大神曲，万花筒般的情感承载其上。这道彩虹立刻触及每个鹦鹉人的内心，帮助他们净化腐败，在难以挽回前将伟大神曲和整个鹦鹉人族裔从悬崖边拉了回来。突如其来的冲击瞬间烧光了大部分的恶魔影响，这个时代的鹦鹉人从接近恶魔的状态转化为新的形态，所有人都被迫去探索该如何重新生活。这一发生在数个世纪前的事件被鹦鹉人称为鸢尾花副歌（Iris Refrain），它标志着怪物之年的结束与荆棘之年（Age of Thorns）的开始。</p>\n<p>鸢尾花副歌无疑将鹦鹉人从可怕的命运中拯救了出来，但这并非故事的结尾。这一突发事件造成鹦鹉人社会的分裂，而那些将堕落注入伟大神曲的恶魔在最后一刻失去了战利品，这让它们愤怒不已。一些鹦鹉人重新陷入恶魔崇拜，一些鹦鹉人则立刻去寻求彻底的救赎、回归奇拉的仁慈之路，而代表大部分鹦鹉人的其他几十个团体则在两者间找到自己的道路。伟大神曲从根本上被重塑为更为复杂、层叠有致的乐曲。新的伟大神曲包含了恶魔的杂质，因此它比过去更为混乱污秽，但在进化中它变得更加复杂和个人化，以至于恶魔不再能利用伟大神曲作为媒介去感染所有鹦鹉人。恶魔们很快意识到女神是故意为之，以此挫败它们未来的阴谋。</p>\n<p>鸢尾花副歌发生在几个世纪前，但其影响一直持续至今。到今天，现代鹦鹉人定居地的许多社会与文化分歧也反映了早期更深层次的分歧，随着时间推移，这些分歧才不再尖锐。</p>\n<p>然而斗争仍在继续。作为一名鹦鹉人冒险者，你在狂野而混乱的神曲中铸造自己的道路，做出的选择将永远描绘你自己与你的歌曲。很快，鹦鹉人先知们将预言第二副歌（Second Refrain）的发生，没有人知道那会带来什么。</p>\n<p>如果你想扮演一个与艺术和歌曲有深刻联系的类鸟角色，在发现自我的旅途中不断平衡内心的善良和邪恶，你应该扮演一位鹦鹉人。</p>\n<h2>你可能… You

Description</h2>\n<p>鹦鹉人是具有鸟类特征的类人生物，形似双足鹦鹉或其他热带鸟类。它们体型相对较小，身高和半身人或人类幼童相仿，长着锋利的喙和多彩的鸟羽。鹦鹉人的脚是鸟类般的爪子，但和鸟类不同，鹦鹉人还有一双复有多彩羽毛的双臂及灵活的手指。</p>\n<p>鹦鹉人的眼睛会根据伟大神曲改变色彩，通常看起来包含了彩虹所有颜色以及可视光谱外的几种颜色。来自其他族裔的谈判者有时会错误地认为他们能在鹦鹉人眼中读出色彩，帮助他们理解鹦鹉人的情绪和意图，但收效甚微；虽然伟大神曲变幻的和声在某种程度上影响着鹦鹉人，但它们并不能可靠地反映鹦鹉人的整体感受。</p>\n<p>鹦鹉人是卵生生物，生来就有一颗用于破壳的卵齿，但此时还没有羽毛。几个月后，婴儿长出了第一茬羽毛，颜色大多暗淡发灰，只有一点点彩色。随着换毛的过程，年轻的鹦鹉人长出颜色越来越鲜艳的新羽，在青春期左右达到成熟的全彩，最终随着鹦鹉人老去逐渐暗淡。年轻鹦鹉人的全彩何时到来会影响他们在同龄人中的受欢迎程度，全彩得早被视为成熟的标志，而全彩得晚可能会遭到嘲笑，或在孩子们的啄序中处于较低地位。</p>\n<p>虽然鹦鹉人天生色彩丰富，它们中的许多人都愿意尝试染羽和羽毛造型艺术，就像类人哺乳生物染发做发型一样。鹦鹉人的羽毛艺术允许他们创造更不同寻常、更有意义或更有吸引力的图案，或时常换个造型保持新鲜感。一些年轻或年长的鹦鹉人会将羽毛染成与原本相近的颜色，好让自己看起来更成熟/年轻。</p>\n<h2>社会 Society</h2>\n<p>混乱而丰富的不同观点组成了鹦鹉人社会，一切都因伟大神曲联系在一起。每个鹦鹉人都以自己的方式体验这首伟大神曲；虽然有少数人声称听到了一首真正的“歌”，但大多数人将其当成一种感受或本能。即使鸢尾花副歌已经是几个世纪前的事，鹦鹉人社区对于他们应该如何发展——无论是个人还是民族整体——仍未达成共识。许多其他族裔成员会有意将聚居地或地区内想法相似的人聚集起来，认为自己与周围人截然不同，并与他人彼此分割。然而，鹦鹉人聚居地中，甚至鹦鹉人家庭中都包含了信念各异的成员，尽管观念不同，他们都仍然会认为自己首先是一个鹦鹉人。</p>\n<p>归根结底，伟大神曲在某种程度上将所有鹦鹉人彼此连接。这导致了聚居地的喧闹、生动和无序，但信念各不相同的鹦鹉人不知怎的让这样的聚居地正常运作着——每个人都在其中扮演不同的角色，混乱中产生更大的和谐。游客们有时会试图将鹦鹉人套进他们更习惯的本族文化中。一般来说，如果他们对鹦鹉人的了解仅止于外表，他们会因共通特征把鹦鹉人划分成热带鸟，如果他们对鹦鹉人文化的了解多一些，那就会根据文化类别去为他们归类。当然，这些努力归根结底是徒劳的。</p>\n<p>一个真正了解鹦鹉人文化的外人会意识到，即使用深层文化映射来分类也有缺陷，因为同一个家庭的成员的信念大相径庭在鹦鹉人中并不奇怪。鹦鹉人文化认为他们的类别更类似于志同道合者的小圈子，就算孩子选择和父母不同的道路，鹦鹉人也觉得这和厌恶运动的人类学者之子成为战士差不了多少。鹦鹉人自己也无法准确地定义他们的类别，类别本身也会随着代际更替和地区而变动。以下是鹦鹉人文化中最常被接受的类别种类，尤其在靛蓝群岛地区。</p>\n<h3>编年史回收者

Reclaimers</h3>\n<p>编年史回收者希望回收和恢复恶魔堕落前的鹦鹉人文化，通过重获失去的一切来一了百了地抵抗恶魔。不幸的是，鹦鹉人社会近乎彻底的堕落导致了大部分机构的崩溃和记录的毁坏，更别说那些口口相传的古老传说了。尽管这让编年史回收者面对的任务看起来近乎无望，但他们也是幸运的，世界上长寿族裔和不朽存在意味着他们可以去问那些在堕落开始前就活着的人。</p>\n<p>然而不幸的是，限制从来是那些长寿存在对鹦鹉人社会的关注程度。时过境迁，连龙都不再记得编年史回收者追寻的东西，奇拉的仆人是剩下最好的信息来源之一。但天族与鹦鹉人的日常生活是脱离的，连最愿意帮忙的天族都是如此，他们要么提供不了正确的信息，要么就需要特定的词组和提问才能获得有用情报。幸运的是，编年史回收者拥有鸢尾花副歌至今所有先驱者的工作成果，这有助于他们的寻找之旅。不用说，回收者们往往会担心信息再次丢失。因此他们会出版多版本的书籍，将其中一些送到国外其他族裔的图书馆中，以防恶魔再次袭击后鹦鹉人需要再次为寻回过去而求助外界。编年史回收者非常可能拥有神裔或歌吻而生传承。</p>\n<h3>恶魔猎手 Demon Hunters</h3>\n<p>恶魔猎手对延续在鹦鹉人血统中的恶魔因子充满愤怒，他们尽其所能地追捕和消灭恶魔，一部分原因是为了预防恶魔的进一步影响，但也出于对复仇的需要。虽然很少有鹦鹉人会容忍一个暴露的寻罪者——选择和恶魔同流合污的鹦鹉人——但恶魔猎手会主动捕杀隐藏的寻罪者，通常也不会因同族之谊而手下留情。不过大部分人区分不了恶魔和其他魔族，因此恶魔猎手有时会发现自己追查的线索引向了完全不同的其他魔族。类似的混淆总会让恶魔猎手沮丧，但不同猎手在发现猎物并非恶魔时反应各异。大部分人仍然会去击败魔族，因为这毕竟也是从世界上除掉了一个邪恶存在。而另一些人会在追查中失去兴趣。毕竟对手并不是他们憎恨的敌人，这种错误削弱了猎手因仇恨而生的热情。</p>\n<p>通常，恶魔猎手的过去或歌声中潜藏着某种创伤，这引领他们积极对抗恶魔。许多鹦鹉人感激恶魔猎手为消灭深恶痛绝的威胁而不惜让自己陷入危险的行为，但他们仍然担忧恶魔猎手体内驱使他们走向暴力的恶魔因子可能有些太多了——即使这些暴力是针对恶魔的。大量未经查证的故事内容都是恶魔猎手发现并击退了一个寻罪者，结果社区却发现猎手找错了人。恶魔猎手则很快辩解道，类似谣言没有事实根据，它们之所以如此轻易传播是因为怕死的寻罪者刻意为之；寻罪者甚至会冒充恶魔猎手去传播谣言。恶魔猎手更可能拥有铁喙、夜视鸟或魔裔传承。</p>\n<h3>边缘行者 Edge Walkers</h3>\n<p>边缘行者的内心与歌声中一直有两种或更多强大的情绪交战，他们要么努力在两者间保持平衡，要么根据情况、自己的情绪和伟大神曲的起伏左右摇摆。对大部分边缘行者来说，在边缘起舞的两种情绪通常是明显且相对对立的，例如愤怒与好奇，但也有一些人在完全对立的情绪间摇摆，例如快乐与悲伤，又或是相关联情绪的两种不同侧面，比如爱与欲望。</p>\n<p>边缘行者相互支持，他们倾向于与其他边缘行者组成半固定的支持小组，讨论他们的情况和感受。生活在外部广阔世界中，身边没有同族的边缘行者则倾向于与愿意提供情感支持的其他族裔成员交流，如此结下的情谊比和其他类别的同族间的更为紧密。边缘行者中各个传承的数量几乎相等，但他们拥有热情之魂传承的几率略高于其他传承。</p>\n<h2>鸢尾花祭司 Iris Celebrants</h2>\n<p>鸢尾花祭司将鸢尾花副歌视为典型的神迹和神力干预，他们花费毕生来崇拜奇拉和副歌，其热情和狂热甚至超过恶魔腐化前的祖先们。他们努力让自己变得善良、热情、充满爱、保持美好的品行，活出最好的自己。鸢尾花祭司看到女神的爱强大到足以直接介入凡世，拯救他们的祖先于毁灭，这令祭司们对未来充满希望，并坚定不移地面对逆境。毕竟，如果他们尽了最大努力还不行，女神最终还是会伸出援手的。这导致其他类别的鹦鹉人认为鸢尾花祭司们有点过于乐观，而歌谣贤者则觉得祭司们过度天真。举例来说，鸢尾花祭司期待着预言揭示的“第二副歌”的可能性，深信它将带来一个黄金时代，而歌谣贤者则对它意味着什么深感忧虑。话虽如此，大多数鹦鹉人都很难真正讨厌鸢尾花祭司，因为祭司们对他人都那么和蔼可亲、善解人意。不过，寻罪者对祭司们的憎恨远超对其他类别的恨，包括对恶魔猎手的。寻罪者尊重恶魔猎手们的愤怒，尽管这种愤怒是针对他们的。鸢尾花祭司们背道而驰的世界观对于寻罪者的思维方式及精神状态来说代表了一种存在主义危机。鸢尾花祭司更可能拥有神裔或热情之魂传承。</p>\n<h3>寻罪者 Sin Seekers</h3>\n<p>寻罪者是邪恶的鹦鹉人，他们企图让自己、伟大神曲和整个鹦鹉人族裔回到恶魔腐化下，拥抱鸢尾花副歌勉强让鹦鹉人逃离的可怕命运。寻罪者将恶魔状态视为一种发泄最卑鄙冲动的自由。他们认为，追随这些冲动便能获得力量，而社会和道德等谎言都是他人为削弱鹦鹉人而编造的。对寻罪者而言，奇拉是个一心想让他们远离伟大的肮脏骗子。</p>\n<p>寻罪者被其他鹦鹉人——尤其是恶魔猎手蔑视，因此他们无法在鹦鹉人社会中公开自己寻罪者的身份。一些人会伪装成另一个类别：边缘行者和随心舞者因其混乱程度而容易伪装，恶魔猎手伪装起来要冒很高风险，但它符合寻罪者的传承，而且一旦有鹦鹉人上当受骗，寻罪者便能得到许多好处。其他寻罪者则成为流放者，与其他寻罪者和恶魔崇拜者一起生活在小集团和邪教中，策划着整个鹦鹉人族裔的灭亡——在他们眼中是族裔的解放。与恶魔猎手一样，寻罪者很可能拥有铁喙、夜视鸟或魔裔传承，这让他们更容易伪装成一个恶魔猎手。</p>\n<h4>寻罪者的异端学说 Sin Seeker Heresies</h4>\n<p>在渴望腐化鹦鹉人族裔的恶魔盟友的帮助下，寻罪者用了几个世纪的时间来建立各种阴谋和异端学说。一些寻罪者对过去几乎完成腐化的恶魔们效忠。其他人支持这些恶魔的对手，他们想在对手失败的地方取得成功。</p>\n<p>寻罪者强烈地相信腐败仍然存在于所有鹦鹉人的灵魂中，这导致他们之间流行起一种将所有鹦鹉人描绘为有罪的异端理论。最流行的一种将七大罪分配给了七种分类。编年史回收者代表贪婪之罪，因他们贪婪地抓住过去、囤积知识。恶魔猎手代表愤怒之罪，他们对恶魔生物的深切愤怒就是铁证。边缘行者代表嫉妒之罪，他们总是位于一件事的边缘，同时嫉妒着另一边。鸢尾花祭司对庇护神祇那不自然的情欲和热情代表色欲之罪。寻罪者本身则代表暴食之罪，渴望沉溺于世界提供的每一种堕落。歌谣贤者代表骄傲之罪，他们过于确定自身知识的优越性，认为他们能理解并控制伟大神曲并借此控制未来。最后，随心舞者代表懒惰之罪，他们太懒了，除了按照自己的奇思妙想懒散行事外什么都不做。不用说，其他分类的所有鹦鹉人都觉得这种理论冒犯至极。</p>\n<h3>歌谣贤者 Song Sages</h3>\n<p>歌谣贤者痴迷于连接所有鹦鹉人的伟大神曲，以及神曲中荡漾的变化。是什么导致每一次变化，这些变化意味着什么？它们预示着什么？对于这些问题，歌谣贤者们感到的不能说是深刻的好奇，更像是必须解决这些问题的需求。他们相信通过真正理解伟大神曲，他们可以进入所有鹦鹉人的集体无意识，并回答关于族裔本质和存在的无数问题。不仅如此，他们或许还能防止类似恶魔侵蚀的灾难再次发生。歌颂贤者对预言揭示的第二副歌的可能性大为困惑。鸢尾花副歌拯救鹦鹉人于灾难，也同时标志着一个时代的结束。因此，尽管鸢尾花副歌是必要的——令人惊叹的——它也同时证明了类似事件有多么重大的影响力，一旦结果不佳，又会带来多大的灾难。歌谣贤者根据他们对伟大神曲的理论倾向扮演着不同角色，包括希望通过研究神曲的旋律洞察鹦鹉人天性的音乐研究者，希望了解鹦鹉人的态度和行为变化如何影响神曲的社会操纵者，以及介于两者之间的人。歌谣贤者更可能拥有歌吻而生传承。</p>\n<h3>随心舞者 Whimsy Dancers</h3>\n<p>随心舞者随心所欲，他们的反复无常让他们更容易适应多变的环境或情况。随心舞者继续这种生活方式，没有多少自我反思，只是如落叶般任反复无常的风吹着自己。随心舞者大多懒散而优柔寡断，也不关心其他分类。一些随心舞者则对此有更深入的思考，并出于哲学观念选择了现在的生活方式。正是这样的鹦鹉人初次创造了“随心舞者”这个词。与其狂妄自大地试图像歌谣贤者一样指挥神曲，不如用舞者一词表示跟随伟大神曲的曲调行动的意愿。随心舞者更可能拥有混沌裔或歌吻而生传承。</p>\n<h2>阵营与宗教 Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>鹦鹉人族裔倾向于混乱中立，但寻罪者几乎都是混乱邪恶，而鸢尾花祭司则几乎都是混乱善良，也有少数和奇拉一样是中立善良。聚居地的鹦鹉人和各分类有类似的阵营差异。</p>\n<p>少数鹦鹉人信仰将他们从可怕命运中解救出来的奇拉，尽管混乱中立阵营并不那么符合女神的教义，这导致了一些摩擦和一些略有差异但更适合鹦鹉人现状的分裂信仰。一些人信仰各种各样的混乱神祇，尤其是那些强调救赎和本身便是赎罪恶魔的神祇。寻罪者几乎只崇拜恶魔领主。有传言称——可能是寻罪者散布的——一些恶毒的恶魔猎手信仰深渊的古老居民和恶魔的敌人，祂们想让恶魔失去影响力。</p>\n<h2>鹦鹉人定居地 G’mayun Settlements</h2>\n<p>世上不存在典型的鹦鹉人聚居地，他们的聚居地既有小村庄也有大城市。鹦鹉人很能接受其他族裔，一些分类的鹦鹉人还会专门寻找其他族裔作为盟友，因此超过一定规模的鹦鹉人聚集地往往会容纳附近的其他族裔，成为混乱的大熔炉。</p>\n<p>名字 Names</p>\n<p>鹦鹉人的名字就像鹦鹉人自己一样混乱多变，它们闻名遐迩，因为鹦鹉人的名字中的撇号数量惊人到能逼哭人类抄写员和编辑。鹦鹉人的语言是一种复杂的气元素语（Auran）方言，尽管在其他族裔中，鹦鹉人有时会使用名字的纯气元素语变体，但不添加方言音调，免得熟人搞错名字。</p>\n<h3>范例名字 Sample Names</h3>\n<p>阿格库亚，阿特艾拉，碧雅乐语，布莱兹奈尔，迪玛缇，库鲁皮，尼克提亚拉，帕茶利，舒莱尼，特兹，乌德兹，乌戈尔。Ag'kuya、Atriella、Biyaq'leyuw、B'reyz'nal、D'marti、Kulupi、N'ktiyat'la、P'qali、Sh'lainn、T'zee、W'derz、W'gor.</p>\n<h2>鹦鹉人传承 G’mayun Heritages</h2>\n<p>鹦鹉人与混沌、天族与恶魔都有深刻联系，因此他们很可能拥有神裔、混沌裔和魔裔多用传承；类似多用传承对鹦鹉人来说为常见，而非罕见。</p>\n<p>大部分鹦鹉人在1级时从以上常见多用传承中或者以下鹦鹉人传承中选择一个。</p>"

        "Hardriggan": {
            "name": "Hardriggan",
            "description": "<p><em>Hardriggans are mighty humanoids with ram-like features, including great curling horns. Quick to assert dominance over others, hardriggans have been painted, sometimes not unfairly, as domineering and bellicose.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>So long ago that history blurs into legend, hardriggans lived in the high mountains among goats and bighorn sheep. Some hardriggan historians insist that they were uplifted from these mundane animals due to their superior aggression and right to rule over the landscape around them, but most hardriggan consider a biological connection to goats or rams to be a bit demeaning.</p>\n<p>Although there&rsquo;s no clear migration that led hardriggans to spread throughout the Indigo Isles, they live across all the islands and have done so for centuries, though not as long as g&rsquo;mayuns. They don&rsquo;t usually gather in large cities of their own, preferring to live in the wild or on the fringes of other communities, where they can gather or raid for resources they desire.</p>\n<p>Most hardriggans across the Indigo Isles are driven by a desire to dominate others; a show of strength is always valid, while submitting to those who are weaker than you is considered immoral. Hardriggans, therefore, rarely get along peacefully, as they&rsquo;re constantly striving to assert superiority over each other. Other ancestries usually see them as aggressive adventurers and warriors at best, and violent tyrants at worst. Those who don&rsquo;t appreciate hardriggans&rsquo; penchant for displays of strength often push most of them away. Hardriggans are usually fine being excluded from soft societies anyway, deeming themselves too strong and independent to play by those rules.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans make good survivalists. They can eat a wide variety of organic items, even rotting wood and rich soil, so they&rsquo;re rarely hungry. They excel at physical tasks and battle strategy, and they move quickly and surely in the wilderness. Many hardriggans have had to fend for themselves since a young age and are used to doing so. Some of them are as impulsive as they are proud, willing to strike out on a new venture with little prompting or preparedness. Their inherent physicality and cleverness mean most hardriggans are comfortable making things up as they go along, proving themselves stronger and more clever than not only their comrades but also their situation.</p>\n<p>As a hardriggan adventurer, you know that you can&rsquo;t tackle great deeds alone and that you might not be able to bully or dictate to fellow adventurers and other weaker people you meet&mdash;even if you still refuse to bow to others. Your strength and self-reliance will take you far, but you can go further with allies at your side. If you want to play a proud, impulsive character with great strength and a powerful personality, you should play a hardriggan.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Like letting others know you&rsquo;re the boss.</li>\n<li>Care little for the laws or fashion of weaker communities that you don&rsquo;t respect.</li>\n<li>Take any advantage you can find, including when others underestimate you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Count on your presence to protect them.</li>\n<li>Admire your tough skull and sharp horns.</li>\n<li>Assume that you are an aggressor or troublemaker.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Hardriggans are strongly muscled humanoids with muscular builds and goat- like features, including thick, curling horns on either side of their heads. They are generally taller and broader than humans; it&rsquo;s not uncommon for a hardriggan to stand 7 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds. Their eyes have horizontal pupils, which gives them a wide range of vision but no particular visual advantage in dim light. They have woolly hair all over their bodies, and this grows particularly thick and tangled on their heads and chests. Most male hardriggans and some female hardriggans grow thicker hair on the chin, appearing as a short beard. This goatlike chin hair gets dirty and matted easily, so frequent hair care and trimming is necessary for good health. Some hardriggans enjoy a shaggy style and work hard to maintain an \"intentionally unkempt\" appearance.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans have very thick, flat skulls and can run head-first into walls or trees without suffering much harm. When they headbutt each other, whether to show dominance or as a simple greeting, the resounding crash can be heard a surprising distance away. Their wounds heal quickly but often scar, so aggressive hardriggans often have a network of overlapping scars atop their heads.</p>\n<p>Hardriggan horns come in a variety of sizes and styles, from short, stout horns that sweep back but curve very little, to tight, dense spirals. They don&rsquo;t project far forward, and are sometimes flat along with the plane of the tops of their heads, making a wider ramming surface. Horn styles run in families, so it&rsquo;s easy to tell when hardriggans are biologically related because their horns look similar. Hardriggans sometimes shape their horns, carving them into jagged sawtooth patterns or splitting small barbs of horn in different directions, and it&rsquo;s uncommon for them to have horn embellishments that are symmetrical.</p>\n<p>Female hardriggans tend to have slightly leaner features and somewhat thinner hair, but these are the only key differences; their horns are just as large and their muscles are slightly stronger, making them very slightly more likely to be dominant than male hardriggans, though it&rsquo;s still close to an even split among hardriggans of all genders.</p>\n<p>These similarities result in a mostly androgynous appearance that some intentionally accentuate and that can sometimes lead other ancestries to have difficulty telling their sex and gender. Hardriggans with obvious physical sex or gender indicators are rarer, but some of them intentionally choose to emphasize their sex or gender as part of their own personal expression. Given the importance that hardriggans place on being able to express themselves and their own feelings, they accept other hardriggans&rsquo; decisions readily, especially when they might change over the course of their life as the hardriggan explores their own identity.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans are usually born singly, although they are rarely born as twins. Hardriggan mothers raise their children until they are able to talk and walk by themselves. After that, in most hardriggan homes, young hardriggans are considered independent and need to find their own place in the world. If they successfully reach adulthood despite the dangers, challenges, and struggles that surround them, they can live up to 60 or 70 years old.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans are densely muscled, with low centers of gravity that give them an exceptional sense of balance and terrifying momentum when they run. Their hands and fingers are wide, giving them a strong grip but good fine motor control. They don&rsquo;t lose much muscle mass as they age, so even an elderly hardriggan is just as tough as a younger one&mdash;and probably significantly more canny.</p>\n<p>As hardriggans continue to explore their identities and appearances over the course of their lives, many hardriggans especially enjoy performing numerous body modifications. Piercings (particularly nose and ear piercings) and intentional scarring are common, and many hardriggans shave or dye patterns in their hair. Tattoos are common but often hard to see when body hair grows over them, so some hardriggans consider their tattoos to be hidden insignias of personal significance.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Hardriggans in the Indigo Isles typically feel no need to form any large communities. Instead, they prefer to gather in small pirate enclaves, hunting towns, adventurer lodges, and mercenary camps. They also prefer to live in the wilderness or on the fringes of other communities, working as hunters, adventurers, mercenaries, and sometimes as criminals. Just because hardriggans don&rsquo;t see a need to have many solely hardriggan communities doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t have a culture just as vibrant as any other ancestry in the Indigo Isles. They simply prefer to live with other ancestries or on their own.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They like to travel and share stories, innovations, and news with other small hardriggan communities when they do. Most hardriggan meetings begin with establishing an order of dominance; whether through boasting of past deeds, clacking heads together, or a quick fistfight, it quickly becomes clear which hardriggan deserves the greater respect at the time (though this may change upon their next meeting; evenly-matched hardriggans spend a lot of time going back and forth as to who should take the lead in their relationship). This pecking order keeps hardriggans woven together in a mesh of society across the Indigo Isles.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans wear their emotions openly and forcefully in nearly every circumstance. They are expressive, impulsive, and passionate, and they are willing to embrace new emotions that arise whenever their current feelings subside. They see roiling emotions as natural forces, like the tides or the winds. And, like waves and storms, their emotions can sometimes be overpowering. Few hardriggans see any reason to hide what they&rsquo;re currently feeling, and even fewer have any practice in doing so. Other hardriggans are used to seeing and respecting another hardriggan&rsquo;s mercurial emotional displays, as they so often do so themselves, but other ancestries can see these displays as overly emotional or erratic.</p>\n<p>Domination, with the strong demanding subservience form the weak, is a critically important part of hardriggan life. It&rsquo;s not something that most other hardriggans consider inappropriate, and in hardriggan society, there are many limitations to what a dominant hardriggan can ask of others. Stronger hardriggans don&rsquo;t usually ask for the moon; they typically request a few things they need at the moment, more so to show that they are in charge than to actually harm or inconvenience the weaker hardriggan. If a weaker hardriggan agrees to submit to a stronger hardriggan, the stronger hardriggan can be just as fierce a protector of the weaker hardriggan against any other threat as if they were an aggressor.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans believe that one&rsquo;s emotions and feelings are wholly and completely one&rsquo;s own, so while a dominant hardriggan may request actions to show loyalty, they can never dictate how another hardriggan feels. For that reason, almost all hardriggan romantic relationships are formed between hardriggans of similar power, which makes them tempestuous and full of friendly struggles to see who is dominant in a particular situation. Hardriggans who try to use their position to coerce the affection of others are considered disgusting and quickly deposed.</p>\n<p>A hardriggan that doesn&rsquo;t know where their strength, bravery, or cunning places them in respect to other people typically becomes nervous and anxious, has a hard time focusing, and is especially prone to picking fights. Even being clearly shown to be in the weaker position is at least an establishment of some position, and that&rsquo;s important in hardriggan culture. Even a hardriggan at the bottom of a chain of dominance at least knows their place and can plan for how to work their way up.</p>\n<p>Thus, groups of hardriggans traditionally sort themselves by strength and prowess into a distinctive hierarchy known as a \"column.\" A column is a strong structure that allows those at the top to see farther, leverage their strength better, and generally be more effective for the entire organization. Each hardriggan wants to be the one at the top, of course, but practical considerations mean that every hardriggan knows that they might need to support others in the hierarchy and bide their time until they can seize a higher place in a new column.</p>\n<p>A column can include any number of hardriggans, depending on the circumstances, but rarely contains more than a few dozen people because, at larger sizes, infighting causes too much friction. A column that disbands through violence or disagreement is called \"toppled.\" No matter the actual cause, the hardriggan at the top of the toppled column is invariably the one who takes the blame if the group couldn&rsquo;t complete an important goal. Columns exist throughout hardriggan society, in bandit gangs, thieves&rsquo; guilds, adventurer societies, mercenary bands, ship crews, family gatherings, and more. A hardriggan who is a member of multiple social groups might hold a different position in the column of each. Outsiders who join hardriggan groups might be initially baffled by the specifics of a column but are undoubtedly aware that they&rsquo;ve been thrust into a hierarchy that is very significant to the hardriggans around them.</p>\n<p>This column structure bleeds into all aspects of hardriggan style and architecture as well; hardriggans prefer to adorn buildings with columns and like tall, straight collections of things. Some hardriggans are even compulsive about arranging things&mdash;stones, barrels, or tools, for example&mdash;into neat lines. Though messy by nature, this unusual urge toward linear order makes them especially good quartermasters, warehousers, and dockworkers.</p>\n<p>While many hardriggan groups uphold traditional hardriggan values, there are several who have new or unusual ideas. Several noteworthy groups within hardriggan society who challenge the status quo are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Fetterbreakers</h3>\n<p>Not all hardriggans are satisfied with the traditional hardriggan belief that dominance is their true birthright and the natural order. These hardriggans rebel against any claim that a sapient creature should put another sapient creature in chains, metaphorical or otherwise. These Fetterbreakers believe in sabotaging prison walls and raiding prison barges to set convicts free, rescuing indentured servants from their servitude, and vanquishing tyrannical bosses and overseers. Given that it&rsquo;s especially common for weaker hardriggans to be among these prisoners and laborers who are being freed, it&rsquo;s no surprise that many of them hold up the Fetterbreakers as liberators and heroes to all hardriggans. However, in truth, Fetterbreakers aren&rsquo;t just freedom fighters; most have a deeper philosophical belief that the current hardriggan social structure is chaining their people to failure. For these reasons, Fetterbreakers work in uncharacteristic equality, without leaders or bosses other than short-term planners who orchestrate their raids. Other traditionalist hardriggans who get to know the Fetterbreakers too closely are sometimes repulsed by their philosophical differences with the standard beliefs of hardriggan culture.</p>\n<h3>Heisters</h3>\n<p>While the traditional hardriggan viewpoint is that a dominant hardriggan relies on pure physicality and aggression to gain status, but a growing number of hardriggans understand that stories of daring deeds can carry more impressive prestige. Tales of hardriggan derring-do are spreading through hardriggan communities, brought by sailors and traders who enjoy the reaction the tales engender. Several ostentatious hardriggans, collectively called Heisters, strive against each other for increasingly elaborate thefts and sabotage against impossible odds. Heisters frequently require local assistance for their impossible-sounding achievements, and they attract local hardriggans to help them by promising them reflected glory if they assist a Heister on a mission.</p>\n<h3>Riggarians</h3>\n<p>Although hardriggan communities are usually very small in number, as a natural consequence of their belligerent natures and eagerness to challenge one another for dominance, there are persistent rumors that hardriggans once had a large city of their own. This city was called Riggaria, but it&rsquo;s not clear where it was&mdash;most claim it was on Goldcrop Island or Bluebell Island, but some insist it must have been on the benighted Moonshadow Island, which explains why its remains haven&rsquo;t ever been found.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no record of how or why hardriggans abandoned Riggaria, if it ever existed at all, but some zealous hardriggans insist that rebuilding lost Riggaria is an important step for all hardriggans on the Indigo Isles to take. These rebuilders, called Riggarians, believe that hardriggan infighting is damaging to their people and to their reputation in the wider world and that Riggaria provides a utopia that will lead to a cultural resurgence. Unfortunately, Riggarians diverge after this point. Some believe that the most important activity is finding the site of the former Riggaria, and that the new city can&rsquo;t be built until it can rise above the ruins of the old. Others believe that Riggaria is an idea and that it doesn&rsquo;t matter where the new city rises. And, of course, any number of hardriggan gang leaders, warlords, and pirate captains believe that they, ahead of any other, are best suited to lead this new city. Riggaria is thus little more than a hopeful fantasy to any of these various Riggarians until some greater leader or power unites the fractious hardriggans to create it.</p>\n<h2>Hardriggan Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Many hardriggans become adventurers, as it&rsquo;s seen as a perfect way to obtain wealth and demonstrate power. A surprising number of hardriggans have already survived on their own from a young age, so the wandering life of an adventurer isn&rsquo;t much of a leap for them. Hardriggans make excellent barbarians, fighters, rangers, and rogues. Those who enjoy boasting make good bards or swashbucklers. Wide-ranging hardriggans might have unusual encounters that introduce strange magic into their blood, so hardriggan sorcerers aren&rsquo;t uncommon. Most hardriggans are too impulsive to make good monks or champions, and hardriggans who study magic formally usually become witches, or wizards. Typical hardriggan backgrounds include bounty hunter, criminal, gladiator, hunter, laborer, miner, prisoner, sailor, or warrior.</p>\n<h2>Hardriggan Settlements</h2>\n<p>Hardriggan settlements are almost always small and usually temporary. Hardriggans are restless when they&rsquo;re idle, so a settlement with a lot of hardriggans in it usually functions best when the community is pulling together for a specific goal: to build a ship, to excavate a mine, or to construct a defensive wall. Hardriggan leaders need to overtly and frequently demonstrate their right to rule, usually by ensuring that other respected inhabitants acknowledge their supremacy, and they need to keep everyone busy. A hardriggan who wants to challenge a powerful leader must first consolidate support, and that usually telegraphs their intention of usurpation early enough that the current leader can prepare for the challenge. Hardriggans in other settlements usually live at the fringes of society, either working demanding jobs to prove their strength or working easy jobs while they run protection rackets, smuggling rings, or gambling dens.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most hardriggans believe that might makes right, and the surest path to gaining respect from others as well as personal fulfillment is by showing dominance. They enjoy pushing against laws, particularly those that they find silly or that don&rsquo;t directly support or protect them. As a result, many hardriggans are chaotic neutral or chaotic evil. Good hardriggans aren&rsquo;t very common, and those good hardriggans who interact with other hardriggans must find some way to demonstrate that they aren&rsquo;t going to stand for being bullied. Those who opt out of the hardriggan dominance entirely usually join the Fetterbreakers.</p>\n<p>Hardriggans don&rsquo;t generally worship deities, as doing so often means subjecting yourself to the dictates of a more powerful being. However, hardriggans respect gods of strength or tyranny such as Hubitza, Sumaworo, Kasa, Baoyan, or Mului sometimes forming small sects to follow them. Members of these \"Godbound\" sects support one another, so sometimes a weaker hardriggan seeking protection or allies turns to one of these sects, regardless of their personal faith.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Hardriggan names have a lot of hard consonants, as hardriggans consider them the \"stronger\" sounds that dominate other letters of the alphabet. They like names that echo well across a battlefield. Hardriggans proudly pick up nicknames that express their great deeds, such as \"Shipbreaker,\" \"Krakenkiller,\" or epithets like \"the Mighty,\" \"the Wealthy,\" or even \"Boss.\"</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Garnikor, Gulpaka, Kolbok, Narshakka, Pahk, Valkikan.</p>"

        "Kragrak": {
            "name": "Kragrak",
            "description": "<p><em>Kragraks are adaptable earth people who transform their earthen forms based on two coming of age rituals and often associate with a secondary element.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Kragraks are an ancient ancestry with a strong connection to the element of earth. A kragrak&rsquo;s connection to the earth manifests in their physical forms, which echo the earthen features of the natural world. While kragraks with bulky gray forms inspired by a mountain range may look quite different from those whose skin evokes the ripples in green coastal sand, these variations in appearance are not based on lineage. It&rsquo;s normal for kragrak families to include kragraks of various different heritages, and kragrak parents encourage each of their children to explore possible body forms as a natural part of their development.</p>\n<p>In addition to their shared connection to earth, many kragraks also feel a lesser connection to a secondary element that reflects their personality, typically chosen from the other elements associated with the Eld. Kragraks group these elements in various categories, and they believe that a kragrak&rsquo;s secondary element and its category have a strong influence on the kragrak&rsquo;s characteristics and capabilities.</p>\n<p>All kragraks are born as pale gray, bipedal humanoids with symmetrical bodies and ash-textured skin. These kragrak childhood forms are extremely resilient and adaptable, with tremendous regenerative ability. In addition, kragrak children are capable of briefly shapeshifting into smaller versions of various adult forms, which they use to try out which shapes feel most natural to them. Many children can even take on the appearance of inanimate rocks or crystals or other transformations dissimilar to the shape of a basic kragrak body. Whichever form they take, kragrak children&rsquo;s appearance is always symmetrical, a feature that greatly assists kragrak families in locating mischievous children attempting to hide away from responsibilities by using their shapeshifting abilities. It&rsquo;s for this reason that symmetrical features are seen as especially childish in kragrak society, while asymmetrical features are a sign of adulthood.</p>\n<p>Eventually, almost every kragrak undergoes two highly personal coming-of-age rituals, during which they physically manifest a variety of features, each of which is intrinsically tied to their identity. The first of these rituals, the Rite of Metamorphosis, is performed once the kragrak reaches roughly the age of 12. During the ritual, kragrak children channel all their transformative power into a stabler form with the help of members of their community, and, like metamorphic rocks, begin to solidify their identity. The features they gain include a heritage, based on how they choose to embody the element of earth, and a name mark, a permanent and unique symbol that appears somewhere on their bodies. The transformation also includes the changes that other ancestries would associate with puberty, with the rapid development of characteristics that are consistent with the kragrak&rsquo;s gender and desired anatomy.</p>\n<p>Kragraks who have completed the Rite of Metamorphosis but who are not yet adults are known in kragrak society as metamorphs. The most obvious way to tell a metamorph apart from a temporarily transforming child is symmetry; metamorphs&rsquo; bodies develop asymmetrical features, such as rocky protrusions on one shoulder but not the other, or hands with different numbers of fingers.</p>\n<p>Around the age of 24, all kragraks undergo a second coming of age ritual, the Rite of Announcement, to formally transition into adulthood. This ritual amplifies the asymmetries in the kragrak&rsquo;s body and causes them to grow to their full adult size. It also augments the kragrak&rsquo;s name mark based on the kragrak&rsquo;s experiences and self-discovery during their metamorph years. The Rite of Announcement is typically a lively occasion, attended by the kragrak&rsquo;s family, friends, mentors, and other figures that have shaped their life&rsquo;s journey.</p>\n<p>While metamorphs and adult kragraks may not be able to heal as quickly as children can, they retain the ability to recover from severe wounds over time, even regrowing lost limbs. When combined with the energy required to move their dense and heavy bodies, kragraks of all ages have voracious appetites.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with a personal connection to the element of earth and a unique worldview shaped by transformative rituals, you should play a kragrak.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carry tangible memories of your most significant experiences with you everywhere you go, in the form of commemorative accessories or earthrunes.</li>\n<li>Seek diverse viewpoints before making important decisions, particularly the viewpoints of people with a different secondary elemental affinity than your own (literal or metaphorical).</li>\n<li>Find value and meaning in asymmetrical features in yourself and others, whether they be asymmetrical physical features, attire, or nuanced philosophies.</li>\n<li>Feel that your secondary elemental affinity helps shape your destiny, either leaning in to its advantages or else rejecting blame for deeds that are in keeping with its pitfalls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe that you are related to earth elementals, eldamon, or other beings with strong elemental ties, and assume you follow the ways of the Eld.</li>\n<li>Expect you to have a deep interest in protecting the environment, especially the earth, and to be uninterested in modern developments in technology or magic.</li>\n<li>Assume that your body is as durable as rock.</li>\n<li>Assume that your choice of kragrak heritage reflects your personality (for example, that all boulder kragraks are slow to act, or that all ash kragraks are impulsive).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kragraks are bipedal, hairless humanoids with earthen features. In childhood, all kragraks have a pale gray ashen form, which is so light that it&rsquo;s almost white in color. The forms that they take as they progress through their metamorph stage and into adulthood depend upon their chosen heritage. The most common heritages are ash, boulder, salt, and sand.</p>\n<p>Ash kragraks choose to maintain an adult form with a connection to volcanic ash. After their transformation, their skin turns a darker gray than their childhood form, and they develop other volcanic features like magma rivulets or obsidian shards in their skin.</p>\n<p>Boulder kragraks are the physically largest heritage and the most similar to what other ancestries expect when they think of kragraks. Their bodies are covered in thick, rocky plates of irregular size and shape. Salt kragraks are most often bright white, but they can also be pink, gray, yellow, or even blue, depending upon the mineral composition of their homeland. Their bodies are studded with asymmetrical patterns made of geometric salt crystals of a variety of shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>Sand kragraks&rsquo; skin takes on the appearance of beaches, deserts, or other sandy areas. This sand&rsquo;s color ranges from almost white through yellow, green, or black. It is more uniform in color than typical beach sand, as it does not contain fragments from marine life. While its color may be uniform, sand kragrak&rsquo;s skin often features ridges reminiscent of the ripples formed by wind and waves, as well as grains of varying sizes.</p>\n<p>Regardless of their heritage, kragraks prize asymmetry as a mark of beauty, maturity, and adulthood. They find the idealized depictions of symmetrical beauty favored by other ancestries to be cute and endearing but ultimately childish. Many kragraks choose to dress to accentuate their own asymmetries, both those granted by the Rites and those they acquired later in life. Their choice of materials depends on the roughness of their skin, with rough and rocky boulder kragraks favoring sturdy materials like leather with copious buckles to allow for easy adjustment, while ash kragraks favor softer fabrics that can be draped and pinned in a variety of styles.</p>\n<p>In addition to clothing, kragraks enjoy ornamentations, such as jewelry, piercings, and the art of inscribing earthrunes. The nature of inscribing earthrunes falls somewhere between tattooing and engraving, depending upon the texture of the kragrak&rsquo;s skin and the composition of their body. Earthrunes can be either colorful or monochromatic, based on the specifications of the kragrak receiving the earthrune as well as the kragrak inscribing it. For instance, kragraks with harder and rockier skin are much more likely to favor simple patterns decorated with inset veins of colorful ore, while kragraks with smooth, ashen skin are much more likely to favor earthrunes with complex patterns. Kragraks prize earthrunes for both their beauty and their expressive artistry.</p>\n<p>Some especially elaborate earthrunes have magical properties as well. Any magical effect that could be captured in a tattoo can also be captured in an earthrune. One of the most common roles of earthrunes is to signify belonging; most kragrak communities develop a unique earthrune pattern that they apply to all adults as a part of the Rite of Announcement, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for kragraks to receive earthrunes that represent organizations that are important to their identity. Kragraks tend to refer to earthrunes by a more specific name based on the geography of the land in which they grew up; for example, kragraks from an island often call them island runes.</p>\n<p>Kragraks also prize scars, as they view them as visual representations of a full life lived and the wisdom gained along the way. A kragrak who has asymmetries that present challenges typically seeks assistive devices that provide accessibility while drawing attention to the difference, such as vibrantly colored prosthetics. When these asymmetries are due to injury, these prosthetics need to be adaptable to account for kragraks&rsquo; ability to regenerate even lost limbs over time.</p>\n<p>Differences in heritage are typically more significant both visually and culturally than differences in gender. Still, there are categories of features that kragraks associate with gender. Kragrak women tend to be physically larger than men. Women&rsquo;s features and adornments tend to be more rounded, while men&rsquo;s features tend to be more angular and defined. Nonbinary kragraks might express their identity in a variety of ways, including by choosing a body form that plays up the contrast between roundness and angularity.</p>\n<h2>Kragrak Settlements</h2>\n<p>Kragraks typically grow up surrounded by others of their ancestry, either in villages that are populated primarily by kragraks or in predominantly kragrak communities in larger multi-ancestry settlements. They favor architecture drawn from rocky natural materials, such as buildings carved from rock or sculpted from hardened sand.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>In kragrak society, engaging in self-discovery in childhood is critical, and parents encourage their children to be willing to take risks and try out different forms, gender expressions, and ways of life in advance of their Rite of Metamorphosis. To promote this discovery, kragraks often take their children to nearby settlements and encourage them to interact with people from all sorts of different ancestries and ways of life that aren&rsquo;t especially common in their home communities.</p>\n<p>After the Rite of Metamorphosis, kragrak metamorphs spend several years adjusting to their new bodies, taking on greater responsibilities, and finding roles for themselves within their community. During this time, they are expected to explore different careers, become self-sufficient, and create experiences and accomplishments worthy of their first earthrunes. With their metamorph name marks, they can begin to build their reputations, and they are allowed to enter into short-term contracts, such as renting property or securing temporary employment as apprentices. Kragraks do not shield metamorphs from the consequences of failure in the way that they protect children, but they generally still consider it reprehensible to take advantage of them for personal gain.</p>\n<p>The Rite of Announcement marks a kragrak metamorph&rsquo;s final transition to adulthood. Their name mark becomes significantly more complex as part of this ritual. It gains patterns that echo the name marks of those who were most important to the kragrak&rsquo;s upbringing and outlook, such as family members, teachers, and rivals; the same sorts of people who would often be invited to the celebration surrounding the rite. It also often contains patterns that represent the kragrak&rsquo;s secondary element. A kragrak&rsquo;s metamorph name remains a visually distinct component of their full name mark. Adult kragraks still use their metamorph name when writing to friends and relatives as a mark of closeness; referring to an adult kragrak by their metamorph name without permission is a surefire way to cause offense.</p>\n<p>While the exact timing of the Rites of Metamorphosis and Announcement can vary from kragrak to kragrak depending on the individual kragraks&rsquo; maturity and how much time they need to understand their identities, the rituals are a central expectation of life. No kragrak could remain a child forever, as a kragrak&rsquo;s childhood form is ultimately unstable. Those who retain it for more than a few decades start to lose their resiliency and crumble into ash, eventually dying unless they possess the strength of body and will to perform an improvised version of the ritual before they perish.</p>\n<p>As adults, kragraks typically retain strong connections to the community that raised them. Many choose to remain a part of that community for their entire lives, though remaining a part of a community doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean the kragrak continues to live in the same place. Kragraks who travel far away from their homeland might stay connected by sending letters and souvenirs. Those who live closer to home are likely to participate actively in raising the next generation as they are able, passing on their skills and sharing stories and mementos of their way of life.</p>\n<p>Kragrak communities typically work hard to see past individual differences and find common ground. Occasionally, a community may choose to exile a member, usually one who has proven unrepentantly violent or malicious. This banishment is formally marked by the erasure of the community&rsquo;s earthrune from the exiled person&rsquo;s body. However, no political structure is immune to corruption, and kragraks have been exiled for false or petty reasons.</p>\n<h2>Secondary Element</h2>\n<p>Each kragrak is associated with the element of earth, but many choose a secondary element that reflects their personality. This secondary element could be any of the ones represented in the ancient teachings of the Eld, from the famous and prominent (such as fire) to the intangible (such as time). This elemental framework is a deeply-rooted part of most kragrak communities, whether their members follow the ways of the Eld or offer prayers to the deities of the balance. The origins of this framework are a matter of discussion and philosophy. Kragraks who follow the Eld are more likely to see these elemental affinities as intrinsic and directed by a connection between the kragrak&rsquo;s soul and elemental forces. Meanwhile, kragraks who follow the Balance are more likely to see the choice of elemental affinity as a matter of self-expression. Most kragraks consider all secondary elements to be valuable, with benefits they bring to society alongside a personal challenge that each kragrak with their affinity must face (though few can escape the bias in favor of their own secondary element). Those who bring out their secondary element&rsquo;s strengths without getting mired in its challenges earn the respect of their peers. The common wisdom in kragrak communities is that it is foolish to make major decisions without consulting with people of different secondary elemental affinities. This preference for varied perspectives is reflected in all aspects of society. On a personal level, kragraks seek such variety in their social circles, and settlements with predominantly kragrak residents favor governing councils.</p>\n<p>Kragraks traditionally group the core twenty elements into four categories, placing earth in a transcendent position that could be considered to belong to any of the other four categories. Nearly all kragraks are at least familiar with this framework, whether they believe in its organization or not. This earth-focused system is certainly not universal to followers of the Eld, and it&rsquo;s rarely used by members of other ancestries. While scholars of other ancestries might note that earth would naturally fit into the static elements to create four even groups of five elements each, many kragraks find this idea fundamentally distasteful, as it diminishes the significance of earth in the service of greater symmetry.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic Elements</strong>: Kragraks believe that the dynamic elements are air, fire, force, light, and lightning. Kragraks with a secondary dynamic element tend to be bold and creative. Undaunted by failure, they seek to chart new paths. At their best, they are optimistic leaders whose revolutionary outlooks inspire innovation and brush aside stagnant ideas in favor of a brighter future. At their worst, dynamic kragraks are short-sighted and destructive. Esoteric Elements: Kragraks believe that the esoteric elements are mind, music, space, spirit, and time. Kragraks with a secondary esoteric element tend to be introspective and adept at considering situations from many different viewpoints. At their best, esoteric kragraks are empathetic, imaginative, and mentally resilient, with a rich inner world. At their worst, esoteric kragraks spend so much time contemplating varied perspectives that they lose their sense of purpose, or at the other extreme, become so dedicated to abstract ideals that they are willing to perform heinous deeds to bring their goals to fruition.</p>\n<p><strong>Static Elements</strong>: Kragraks believe that the static elements are darkness, death, ice, and metal. Kragraks with a secondary static element tend to be dependable. They seek lessons from what has come before, learning from their ancestors and mentors. They are patient and prefer slow, incremental change to dramatic revolution. At their best, they are knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy. At their worst, static kragraks are dogmatic, judgmental, and unwilling to compromise.</p>\n<p><strong>Vital Elements</strong>: Kragraks believe that the vital elements are body, life, poison, wood, and water. Kragraks with a vital secondary element tend to be well-aware of the cycles of life that surround them. They nurture life at whatever scale feels natural to them, be it in training for physical fitness (most common among those of the body element), cultivating gardens (most common among those of the wood or poison elements), or maintaining the health of broader ecosystems (most common among those of the life and water elements). At their best, vital kragraks are caretakers of their communities and ecosystems, taking on respected roles that nurture those around them. At their worst, vital kragraks bend their understanding of life toward harmful ends, such as terrorizing others with monsters or practicing unethical science.</p>\n<h2>Volcanic Rebirth</h2>\n<p>While many kragraks remain satisfied with the identities they embody during their coming-of-age rituals, not all of them continue to experience harmony between their minds and their physical forms. Those who experience a significant dissonance, whether it be with their heritage, secondary element, physical sex, or even their name mark, can undergo a ritual called the Rite of Volcanic Rebirth to change these features. The ritual momentarily restores the mutability of their childhood form, allowing them to change the parts of their body that do not align with their identity. The ritual is safer than most, but it requires several weeks of preparation. Kragraks often invite their most trusted friends and allies to participate and to celebrate the ritual&rsquo;s aftermath.</p>\n<p>The Rite of Volcanic Rebirth is not to be undertaken lightly, or by those who embrace their current identities. A kragrak legend speaks of an exiled criminal who attempted to undergo the rite to change her name mark and appearance, so that she could secretly return to the land from which she had been banished. She attempted to trick the rite into giving her a new name and heritage, but try as she might, the ritual&rsquo;s magic only allowed itself to be shaped back into her true identity. As she struggled to trick the ritual, her soul slipped away, and her body crumbled to lifeless ash.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Kragraks can be of any alignment. There is no direct association between heritage and alignment, but each category of secondary element comes with an alignment tendency. Kragraks of the dynamic elements are more likely to be chaotic, while kragraks of the static elements are more likely to be lawful. Meanwhile, kragraks of the vital elements and esoteric elements tend toward neutrality on the scale of law and chaos. None of the elements is particularly associated with good or evil.</p>\n<p>Thanks to their strong connection to the elements, kragraks are also more likely than members of most other ancestries to follow the teachings of the Eld. But while the Eld&rsquo;s traditions remain a significant part of kragrak culture, more and more kragraks have sought other philosophies. In modern times, many kragraks follow deities of the Balance. Those who retain a more conventional outlook are likely to choose Gaia or a deity associated with their element, such as Aoz or Zoa for life and death, but kragraks can worship any deity.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Kragraks have two primary types of names they use in distinctive contexts. The first is the kragrak&rsquo;s speech name, which can be verbal, signed, or both. A kragrak&rsquo;s speech names typically include pieces of the speech name their parents gave them as children, as well as pieces of the speech names of others who have been influential to them throughout their lives. Speech names rarely include titles or accomplishments, as most kragraks believe such things are better captured in durable earthrunes than they are in impermanent speech. Names that may at first appear symmetrical but break from that symmetry in a clear way, like the word kragrak itself, are consistently popular. Since many kragrak names come from the Terran language, they favor hard consonants. The second type of name is a name mark, which kragraks use as their signature in written communication. The sample names provided below represent speech names.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Torgvat, Rupnur, Zovalov, Grotgran, Kolod.</p>\n<h2>Kragrak Heritages</h2>\n<p>Kragrak heritages demonstrate the way that each kragrak experiences their own personal connection to the element of earth. The four most common heritages are ash, boulder, salt, and sand. Each of these heritages is also associated with one of the categories of elements. Kragraks of that heritage are somewhat more likely to have secondary elements in that category, but those are only general tendencies. Ultimately all combinations of heritage and secondary element are possible. Since ash comes from fire and travels upon the wind, ash kragraks are associated with the dynamic elements. The heavy and solid bodies of boulder kragraks are associated with the static elements. Sand kragraks are associated with the vital elements, thanks to their connection with the sea as well as the endurance required to survive in harsh desert climates. Salt kragraks are associated with the esoteric elements and the occult, because of the protective properties that salt provides against supernatural forces as well as the harmonic potential of the geometric crystals on their bodies.</p>"

        "Orpok": {
            "name": "Orpok",
            "description": "<p><em>Orpoks are stout humanoids with porcine features. They have keen senses of smell and taste, making them peerless gourmands. Hardy and hardworking, many orpoks prefer well-earned lives of ease.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Orpoks are recent arrivals to the Indigo Isles, having appeared in a fleet of wide-bottomed sailing vessels about 200 years ago. The orpoks who worked the ships had been born on them, and their elders spoke only vaguely of some great tragedy that they had escaped many years before. The knowledge of the orpok homeland died with these elders, and orpoks today don&rsquo;t have much to say about their lost ancestral homelands.</p>\n<p>Despite the distant tragedy, orpoks didn&rsquo;t arrive as empty- handed refugees. Their vessels were filled with all manner of crafts, treatises, and treasures. Wherever orpoks came from, they had time to compile all that they needed to preserve their culture and settle someplace anew. In particular, the ships&rsquo; holds were bursting with cookbooks and cooking implements, herbs and spices unknown in the Indigo Isles and the potted plants to regrow them, treasures such as silver and gemstones, and beautiful works of art, mostly in the form of exceptional furniture. Cookbooks served as primers to teach young orpoks to read and write. The furniture provided excellent examples of how to construct useful, comfortable things. Books explaining how to hunt, kill, and cook a variety of beasts were used to teach young orpoks the arts of combat. These materials, though extensive, were noticeably lacking in maps, histories, or anything that would tell the new generation where they had come from or why they left.</p>\n<p>The orpok fleet arrived on Bluebell Island, in the deep bay where they would soon build the town of Seaview. The event is celebrated as \"Landfall Day,\" although the actual arrival spanned several weeks, as some of the vessels had been delayed by a storm and had to catch up. On Bluebell Island, orpoks easily found space among the few small communities of g&rsquo;mayuns, hardriggans, and others and began establishing settlements that respected these other communities&mdash;but, importantly, they discovered the bluebell plants that grew wild across the island. Their books said nothing of these flowers, but the industrious settlers soon realized that bluebell plants have an extraordinary number of uses: in dyes, cooking, textiles, ropemaking, insulation, paper, and more. Furthermore, the bluebell plants took easily to cultivation of the type described in their books. Many orpoks believed that their wandering days were coming to an end, and that the bluebell plants were a sign that they were to establish a new civilization here, expanding on the culture they had brought aboard their ships. Orpoks made homes in these settlements where they were welcome and built their own communities all across Bluebell Island. Although they&rsquo;d arrived as mariners, most orpoks quickly adapted to a settled, landbound life. The settlement of Bluebell Island is now viewed as a peaceful time of collaboration and industry, but it doesn&rsquo;t take a close look at orpok history to see that this wasn&rsquo;t the case. Some of the fleet captains rebelled at settling down on land; the oceangoing life was all they&rsquo;d ever known, after all. It was clear that something had compelled orpoks to take to the open sea, and some felt that turning to a landbound life was a betrayal of their directive. Only a decade after orpoks had arrived on Bluebell Island and settled in, these restless orpoks took one of the largest vessels in the fleet, the Wide Whale, and sailed away from Bluebell Island. They haven&rsquo;t been seen again, but their bold decision has since inspired generations of orpok explorers who strive to know what&rsquo;s over the horizon.</p>\n<p>As an orpok adventurer, you eschew the sedentary, community-focused life most orpoks lead (either by your nature or your circumstances). You recognize that exploration is as much a birthright of orpoks as easy living, and you will write your name among the annals of orpok heroes.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a porcine character with a keen nose, a sturdy body, and culinary sensibilities, you should play an orpok.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy eating often, both as an experience for the senses and as a way to bond with others.</li>\n<li>Be willing to shoulder a lot of work to make things easier for your friends.</li>\n<li>Take it easy when there&rsquo;s not a pressing need for immediate effort.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your keen senses and assume you can prepare tasty meals or recommend quality eating establishments.</li>\n<li>Underestimate the amount of hardship you can endure (and the work you can perform) when necessary.</li>\n<li>Assume that you prefer eating to any other endeavor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Orpoks are humanoids with distinctly pig-like features, including a porcine nose, floppy ears, tusks, and cloven hooves at the ends of their feet. They are nearly as tall as a human but significantly more stout; they tend to be heavy but carry their excess weight well on sturdy bones. Their eyes are often small and sunk back into their heads, like a pig&rsquo;s. Their hands end in three blunt fingers and a thumb. Orpoks have hair all over their bodies; this hair is usually fine, showing their skin color that ranges from light pink to brown so dark as to appear black. Some orpoks have thicker hair that gives them a bristly look, and others have a thin, clear layer of grease that makes them look oily all the time. Although their vision and hearing aren&rsquo;t much keener than that of humans, orpoks have well-defined senses of taste and smell. They can detect subtle gradations of flavor in their food that most other creatures miss, and they find a complex flavor to be a very enjoyable sensation. They tend to snort when they eat, not out of greed or rudeness, but due to air escaping through their nose as they move a flavorful bite around in their mouths.</p>\n<p>Orpoks generally have large families; litters of six or eight orpoks aren&rsquo;t uncommon, and most families consist of three or four litters. Although their birth rate is very high, orpoks have relatively short lifespans. Orpoks are physically mature by the end of their first decade of life, and few orpoks survive past 35 years of age. An older orpok shows their age with their hair becoming white (eventually manifesting as a soft white fuzz over the orpok&rsquo;s entire body) and their eyesight becoming increasingly poor. Even many middle-aged orpoks prefer spectacles to correct their declining vision.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Orpoks society stresses civic unity and tradition. Orpoks are expected to support not only their families&mdash;particularly the elderly and young in their families&mdash;but the entire community in which they live. A simple, sedentary life is widely held as the orpok ideal, but orpoks are canny enough to realize that ease doesn&rsquo;t come without hard work to pave the way. Orpoks thus engage in diligent, cooperative efforts to ensure a good life for themselves and those who come after them in their community. People of other ancestries sometimes remark that orpoks work quite hard just to take it easy, but orpoks don&rsquo;t see this as a conflict.</p>\n<p>Most aspects of orpok life revolve around food. Cuisine is the chief subject in casual orpok conversation, and most orpoks can describe in detail the best meals they&rsquo;ve ever eaten&mdash;and will do so with little prompting. Food-related metaphors are common, and their vaunted institutions, such as the government, courts, and institutions of higher learning, often incorporate food-related concepts or titles.</p>\n<p>Orpoks generally eat seven meals each day and never do so in a hurry if they can avoid it. Although orpoks often defer to the most skilled chef during the preparation of a meal, everyone pitches in to help cook in whatever way they&rsquo;re best suited to provide&mdash; even a clumsy orpok youth who can barely boil water, chips in by fetching ingredients or cleaning up. Orpok celebrations, such as weddings, births, or funerals, always revolve around an elaborate meal. Specific foods carry traditional meanings for these cultural celebrations, such as a wedding&rsquo;s multilayered cake to signify years of ascending love or a funeral&rsquo;s traditional potato casserole to acknowledge a body&rsquo;s return to the earth.</p>\n<p>Orpoks love to eat, but they are never sloppy or frantic about it. Orpoks have some of the most convoluted table manners throughout the Indigo Isles, and anyone who attends a fancy orpok meal without comprehending the dizzying array of cutlery and courses is seen as unsophisticated. However, even an egregious lack of proper manners can be overcome with excessive compliments to the chef for each dish. Orpoks love eating out at restaurants, both to sample a wide variety of flavors and as a chance to meet up with friends. In many orpok settlements, restaurants outnumber all other businesses combined. Any orpok proud of their cooking skills is likely to establish one, even if their other duties mean they can only operate their restaurant at sporadic hours. Far from discouraging business, a restaurant with irregular operating times is often viewed as an epicurean dare, where nabbing a table is a mark of prestige.</p>\n<p>Orpoks like to wear layers of clothing; in warm climates, they layer light or loose fabrics to avoid overheating. Rare or colorful fabrics are seen as a demarcation of status, so any orpok who can acquire velvet, silk, or similar luxurious fabrics likes to show them off. Many orpoks enjoy wearing hats, with a&nbsp;high toque with a billowing top being the most traditional, and thus most often replicated, style of headgear. Noteworthy groups within orpok society are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Forerunners</h3>\n<p>Some orpoks claim that there were a handful of orpoks in the Indigo Isles even before the arrival of the great orpok fleet. These legends are bolstered by some carvings and mosaics in ancient ruins across the isles, which display images of humanoid figures with porcine features like hooves, snouts, and tusks. Most orpoks dismiss these images as either coincidences or frauds, but a determined subset of orpoks speak of the \"forerunners,\" or orpok explorers who found the Indigo Isles in the very distant past. Those who believe in these ancient orpoks, or consider themselves to be descended from them, call themselves the forerunners. The forerunners aren&rsquo;t formally organized as they can&rsquo;t agree on any history or origin for their ancestors&mdash;indeed, they can&rsquo;t even agree on what traits indicate such ancestry. Some claim that orpoks with more pronounced tusks must be descended from the forerunners, while others claim that a sense of psychic, ancestral \"oneness\" with the island is sufficient.</p>\n<h3>Gourmediators</h3>\n<p>Food is a critical component of orpok society, and the greatest orpok chefs are renowned not only for making good food but also for bringing people together over their meals. Many orpok stories center around a feud between families or communities that&rsquo;s solved when chefs from the opposing sides realize they must create a meal together and, in so doing, learn from each other, mending the rift. \"And they came together for a wonderful meal\" is the orpok equivalent of \"and they all lived happily ever after.\" The greatest orpok chefs take their charge of bringing people together quite seriously and hone their diplomatic skills as much as their culinary ones. These gourmediators serve as peacekeepers, envoys, and magistrates in orpok society. The best of these have graduated from the most distinguished orpok learning institutions, such as the Academy of Tastes in Seaview.</p>\n<h3>Hamfisted</h3>\n<p>Orpok criminals are rare, as are orpok bullies, but a small group of orpoks are both. These outcasts and reprobates have decided that orpok society is a fruit ripe for the plucking, and that they&rsquo;re the ones to pluck it. Collectively called the \"hamfisted\" both for their brutally straightforward crimes as well as their tendency to pick fistfights, these orpoks are considered something between a nuisance and a menace to orpok society. There isn&rsquo;t any central organization of hamfisted; it&rsquo;s a catch-all term that incorporates lone hoodlums, bandit gangs, or protection racketeers. The hamfisted tend to be leaner than other orpoks as a result of living in small, desperate, ill-mannered groups on the fringes of orderly orpok society. A hamfisted that doesn&rsquo;t bear scarred knuckles from past fights is hardly worthy of the moniker.</p>\n<h3>Wide Whalers</h3>\n<p>The departure of the Wide Whale so soon after the orpok&rsquo;s arrival on Bluebell Island was a cultural touchpoint and an overt rejection of the sedentary, landbound life that many orpoks chose shortly after their fleet&rsquo;s arrival. The Wide Whale hasn&rsquo;t been seen again, but some orpoks take its lesson as a guide for living; these \"wide whalers\" rarely stay in one place for long and always strive to see what&rsquo;s just beyond the horizon. Though they seem to reject traditional orpok life, traveling wide whalers nevertheless serve an important role in orpok society, spreading news, messages, and inventions to multiple settlements. Most orpoks consider this life to be downright dangerous, but orpok heroes who have recovered opulent treasures, returned home with exciting new recipes, or vanquished great threats nevertheless hold positions of respect in orpok society, and their descendants tend to become orpok aristocracy. Most wide whalers strive to join the ranks of these legendary figures.</p>\n<h2>Orpok Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Orpok adventurers are relatively rare, as orpoks enjoy the comforts of home and like working to build their communities. Those orpoks who take to the roads or the seas usually don&rsquo;t intend a totally itinerant life and typically plan regular trips home (although misfortune might delay or prevent these anticipated homecomings). Orpoks are tough and personable, so they make excellent bards, champions, and fighters. They also make good alchemists. They might lack the manual dexterity that other ancestries have, but they are quick thinkers and make good investigators and wizards. They only rarely pursue nature-bound classes such as barbarians, druids, and rangers, so orpoks with these skills can help their communities in unique ways that make them highly valued. Typical orpok backgrounds include artisan, barkeep, barrister, cook (Pathfinder Second Edition Advanced Player&rsquo;s Guide), emissary, farmhand, herbalist, noble, and scholar.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most orpoks enjoy working in a structured, predictable society and don&rsquo;t mind putting in the work to make that society function. Most are lawful neutral, but many are lawful good. Orpoks who aren&rsquo;t lawful are usually travelers, traders, or other people who enjoy a more ephemeral or peripatetic existence, and that usually includes adventurers. Evil orpoks aren&rsquo;t generally wicked demon worshipers or despicable tyrants, but are instead bullies or misanthropes who engage in petty cruelties and evils. Most of these miscreants align themselves with the hamfisted, who see nothing wrong with taking what they want by force.</p>\n<p>Few orpoks are religious, but those who are often venerate lawful deities of civilization and community such as Tova and Wera, with respect, if not full adherence, for Ebrugeses the goddess of feasts. Organized religions are rare among orpoks, but a fervent faith can strike anyone, so orpok evangelists and fanatics are uncommon but not unknown.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Orpok names are generally rolling and are typically chosen so they are easy to pronounce, even for the very young. Orpoks have expressive lips beneath their snouts, and their names include a lot of consonants. Their first names rarely include more than one or two vowels, even if a vowel is repeated multiple times, but family names tend to be longer and more complex. The orpok language is tonally complex but tends to sound like burbling to those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with its nuances.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alshaba, Bippin, Gennel, Motollow, Munmun, Nonnino, Pumbus, Webben.</p>\n<h3>Sample Family Names</h3>\n<p>Harbendarben, Limbinnin, Lobronkew, Molliheel, Proonder, Ramblurin, Wonnihew.</p>\n<h2>Orpok Heritages</h2>\n<p>Orpoks are quick to manifest physiological differences based on the lives their ancestors led. As they have a relatively short lifespan, orpoks have manifested many heritages in only a short amount of time in the Indigo Isles.</p>"
