The dark naga sees other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must be eliminated.</p>\n<p>Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken, searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those unlucky trespassers into a dark naga's lair typically find themselves as the naga's slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster's poison or incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave finer luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object of worship.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>",

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>"

When the opportunity presents itself, they destroy the schematics and formulae that other organizations, inventors, and alchemists have created if they can't steal them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Deep under the surface of Golarion, dwarves still dwell in the darkness. Once abandoned by their kin who were obsessed with reaching the surface, these dwarves have found that by working harder than their brethren, they can build a society far greater than anything under the sun. Droskar, Master of the Dark Furnace, teaches them that toiling for their masters, who in turn toil for their masters above, will lead all of them to become stronger than ever. Every hryngar knows that their labor defines them, and brings them glory in the eyes of Droskar and their peers. Exhaustion at the end of the work day is an honor, proof of their worth in society.</p>\n<h2>Bleeding Edge Killing Tech</h2>\n<p>Hryngar assassins use the most advanced gadgets and technology available to them. Their inventors are hard at work reverse engineering any specialized equipment they find so they can provide moderately equivalent designs to the best assassins. Elite assassins gain one consumable gadget (Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears) of their level or lower, often selected for a specific job.</p>"

These young worms tend to be more aggressive towards other life forms than their relatively mellow adult kin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>"

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

These young worms tend to be more aggressive towards other life forms than their relatively mellow adult kin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>"

Gremlins tend to denigrate, bully, or even slaughter their lesser kin, particularly mitflits, whom gremlins (and many others) derisively call \"mites.\"</p>",

Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.</p>\n<p>Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds' innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can.

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>"

These young worms tend to be more aggressive towards other life forms than their relatively mellow adult kin.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>",

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>",

In these cases, the sporeborn mycelial network burrows through the corpse, replacing the original hyphae in fungal creatures and the xylem and pith in plants. This allows the sporeborn to puppet the creature, much as it does in mammals by replacing the tendons with its own rugged mycelium. Fungus and plant hosts are more likely to develop the potent poison sporeborn ability to enhance the hosts' natural abilities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a mindless guardian is needed, but the ethical bounds of creating undead are too uncouth, ritual casters may turn to a more fungal solution by creating a mycoguardian. Using valuable parasitic fungal spores, a ritualist may seed the corpse of a creature and encourage them to grow, sending mycelium tendrils throughout the body. The tendrils bond to mobile tissue such as bones, while replacing tendons with reinforced mycelium. This ritual magically replicates the yellow musk creepers' ability to spread throughout a dead organism then mobilize its body. But rather than a completely mindless fungal carrier, the ritualist has some control over the infested creature's behavior.</p>\n<p>The magic of the ritual includes basic instructions and rules that guide the new fungal mycoguardian (in this case, a sporeborn). Simple instructions like \"guard this room\" or \"slay all of the tiny creatures in this basement\" should work well enough, but complex commands such as \"deliver this letter to the Harbormaster of Caliphas\" are doomed to failure.</p>\n<h2>Fungel Ristualists</h2>\n<p>While mycoguardians are rare, several different types of primal spellcasters might create a mycoguardian. Druids might turn the bodies of a poacher's victim against the poacher, seeking to avenge the wrongful death and rebalance the scales of life. Leshy spellcasters create mycoguardians to protect their hidden communities and sacred groves. The fey of Northern Fangwood transform fallen or rotted trees into crustoreal mycoguardians, massive arboreal-looking creatures covered in parasitic lichen. These lumbering sentinels patrol their borders, crushing all non-fey who dare approach. There are rumors of crustoreals being imbued with void energy from the Gravelands and going berserk.</p>\n<h2>Creating Mycoguardians</h2>\n<p>To create a mycoguardian, such as a sporeborn, a ritualist can perform a ritual similar to create undead (Pathfinder Core Rulebook 411) called create mycoguardian, but providing valuable parasitic fungal spores instead of black onyx. This ritual uses Fungus Lore (trained) or Nature (expert) for both the Primary Check and Secondary Checks, and lacks the Evil trait.</p>\n<h2>Different Mycoguardians</h2>\n<p>In addition to the sporeborn presented here, there are many versions of the create mycoguardian ritual for making mycoguardians other than sporeborn, such as for aquatic chytridions and so on. Some forms of mycoguardians, such as mycelial mindbores, come to be using their own unique methods and can't be created with a version of create mycoguardian.</p>"

Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.</p>\n<p>As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.</p>\n<p>Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.</p>",

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>"

            "publicNotes": "<p>While gestating, cave worms adapt to their surrounding environments, becoming accustomed to extreme temperatures and hazards nearby. For example, cave worms hatched in volcanic environments mature into crimson worms, while those raised near water sources mature into azure worms. Regardless of their environment, larval cave worms all have translucent bodies and pallid carapaces that harden and change color as they mature. When a brood of cave worms hatches from their eggs, the foot-long worms mass together, forming a swarm of ravenous larval worms. This swarm travels ceaselessly, consuming anything in its path. The young are drawn to movement, as living, squirming prey tends to be the most nutritious. As they age, they incorporate more minerals into their diet to support carapace growth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cave worms are gigantic scavengers who shape their environment as they bore through rock, ice, or other substances on their search for food. These behemoths consume everything in their path. Though they usually prefer soil, minerals, and occasionally constructed buildings, they will also eat living creatures, plants, and other organic materials. There are numerous species of cave worms, each a different color and perfectly adapted to their surrounding environment. Cave worms rarely exceed a typical animal's intelligence. They're also poor parents that lay a clutch of eggs sealed in a protein shell before abandoning them. After a short incubation period, the young hatch, forming a swarming mass of ravenous larval cave worms. When nearing maturity or when starved of sufficiently rich soil, these larval worms turn on one another. They fight for dominance or flee until only a few remain. The survivors grow quickly, rapidly becoming juvenile cave worms.</p>\n<h2>Brood Variance</h2>\n<p>The cave worms presented here are typical of standard rock worms. For crimson worms, use the elite adjustment and add immunity to fire. For azure worms, increase their swim Speed to 40. Gray worms gain void healing and a weakness to vitality energy 5. Glacial worms gain immunity to cold.</p>\n<h2>Early Hatchling</h2>\n<p>A single cave worm egg can produce several thousand larval cave worms when it slowly matures over a millennia. However, if a cave worm egg is disturbed or damaged before its natural cycle completes, the egg enters a rapid stage of maturation. Only a few hundred worms survive this process, creating significantly fewer offspring than when allowed to mature slowly.</p>"

This has even led to the saying \"as slow as a well-fed basilisk.\" Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.</p>\n<p>An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they're agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.</p>\n<p>For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.</p>"
