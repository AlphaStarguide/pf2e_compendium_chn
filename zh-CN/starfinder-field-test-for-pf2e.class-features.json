Foes you suppress quickly stumble while attempting to overcome your durability, granting you an edge in absorbing their incoming firepower. You likely move to the forefront and try to focus your enemy's attention on yourself.</p>\n<p>You never count as being in the area of a ranged weapon you've made an attack with. In addition, you gain resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1) against attacks made from @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} targets.</p>"

You've come to terms with the fact that your weapons might sometimes hit your allies but work to minimize such instances of unintentional \"friendly fire.\" In fact, you've honed your skill with heavy weapons so much that all but the most indirect of strikes causes your opponents to duck down or force them to adapt to the havoc you unleash.</p>\n<p>When you attack with an area weapon, you adjust the shot to allow allies to better avoid it. Decrease the DC by 2 for any allies who need to make a save against your area effects. In addition, enemies who succeed (but not critically succeed) their save against an area attack you make are still @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} until the start of your next turn.</p>"

You're able to easily switch between long range and close combat, allowing you to better stand your ground when you need to, or defend your allies in a tricky situation. Blows with heavy close combat weapons punish your foes just as effectively as when you fire a rotolaser or a missile launcher.</p>\n<p>When you successfully make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon, you @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed} the target until the start of your next turn.

If two or more creatures are closest and equidistant, you can choose which one is your primary target. Other creatures within the area of effect must save against the effect as normal.
