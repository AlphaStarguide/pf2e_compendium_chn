		"Death Coach": {
			"name": "Death Coach",
			"publicNotes": "<p>Roads are liminal spaces, existing to connect people and places but rarely destinations in and of themselves. Some see them as avenues to profit. Roadside inns can be lucrative businesses between metropolitan areas, and even villains such as bandits can earn a living plying their larcenous trade on various highways. Occasionally, a road will gain a dire reputation from banditry, treacherous terrain, or a history of deadly accidents. Despite this notoriety, such roads often remain in use simply because they are an important artery of travel or alternative routes prove impractical. On such roads, those stained with the blood of travelers or flooded with fear and anger, do death coaches ride.</p>\n<p>A death coach is the spiritual manifestation of the dangers of travel. It appears as a faintly translucent wheeled carriage pulled by one or two ghostly mounts, usually in the dead of night on a lonely bit of road. The coach and the mounts are a single spirit and can never be separated. A death coach has no driver, and anyone able to peek past the thick curtains covering the carriage windows will find the vehicle empty... unless the death coach has recently collected a soul.</p>\n<p>A palpable aura of dread surrounds a death coach, its very presence a harbinger of what is to come. A creature that dies near a death coach might have their soul trapped within. Such unfortunates manifest as incorporeal likenesses of their former selves seated within the carriage, their faces showing no emotion. They seem unaware of their fate and fail to notice anyone outside the carriage. After a death coach collects a soul or two, it rides off into the darkness with its prizes. Over the next few hours, any souls trapped within simply fade into nothingness, consigned to oblivion. Some scholars believe the death coach feeds off the souls it collects to maintain its unlife, while others think the energy of those souls eventually coalesces into another death coach, though it never appears on the same road.</p>\n<p>No one knows for certain what causes a death coach to haunt a particular road, but once one begins killing travelers for their souls, the rumors soon reach nearby communities. Sometimes, the road is abandoned entirely, leaving the death coach without sustenance. If left alone for long enough, the negative energy infusing the area slowly dissipates until the road is safe to travel once more, but if even one group of misguided travelers looking for a shortcut heads down the weed-choked lane, the death coach rises from its torpor to forcefully transport these unwilling souls. If it succeeds, the cycle begins anew.</p>\n<p>Other times, the communities in the area can't afford to establish a new route (or are physically incapable of doing so, in the case of mountainous regions), and so must continue to use the haunted road. The locals often mark such roads with signs to warn outsiders of the dangers, but the surprisingly clever death coaches do their best to destroy such notices. Canny travelers passing through unknown areas at night should remain on the lookout for damaged or disturbed signs to ensure they don't heedlessly head into a death coach's domain.</p>\n<p>Destroying the death coach is the only way to render the road safe until such time as a new tragedy accumulates enough negative energy to create another death coach. Some might believe this incarnation to be the first death coach returning for vengeance, but in reality, it is an entirely different undead creature. A careful inspection (which is difficult to achieve) reveals minor differences between the two death coaches, perhaps reflecting more recent carriage designs, though the newer spirit is as hungry for souls as the old.</p>",

In due course, the priests of the serpentfolk learned to replicate their lord's trick, and in the millennia since the serpentfolk's fall, the knowledge has slithered into the libraries of other necromancers and sorcerers.</p>\n<p>Despite their menacing reputation and great power, hollow serpents are a relatively uncomplicated creation. They were designed first and foremost as guardians, and serpentfolk liches of a suitable level of power are sometimes accompanied by hollow serpents. A few have struck out on their own over the years, usually due to outliving their original creators. Driven by their hunger and dim intellect, they take up residence in remote ruins or deep caverns.

This curse drains its victim's vitality slowly over time, almost appearing to be a form of long-term wasting disease that no medicine can ever cure. The royal stricken by the curse sickens and wastes away until they finally perish, rising as a pale sovereign after death. The appearance of a pale sovereign is similar to their form in life, but so deathly pale and gaunt that no one who resists the mind-clouding effects of their aura would mistake them as living.</p>\n<p>The curse is known by many names across various worlds—the Wasting, Blighted Legacy, Unraveled Heraldry—but its effects are the same. After suffering the curse, members of a royal bloodline begin to die out, their descendants dwindling, until only one is left. Upon becoming the last remaining member of their line, the unfortunate royal undergoes the transformation into a pale sovereign, the power and potential of the entire line channeled into one extremely dangerous undead creature, even if the royal was relatively inconsequential and unskilled in life.</p>\n<p>The methods of inflicting the curse vary. Generally it's the result of rare occult rituals requiring a spellcaster of great power. Sometimes the curse is used to target a royal line abusing its authority, but just as often it's used by malicious forces against benevolent rulers or simply out of spite by the instigating caster. Mentioned only in whispers and veiled allusions, the curse is greatly feared by royal families who know of it. Be cautious in your dealings, the rumors say, and be careful who you spurn, for you never know what power they may wield.</p>\n<p>More rarely, a pale sovereign can arise spontaneously if the last of a royal line dies while under a curse or due to a curse, particularly if they died with tasks left unfinished or as the result of a betrayal. Any curse will do in these rare instances, and it's possible that the first pale sovereign formed in this way.</p>\n<p>Though morose and brooding, pale sovereigns are usually neutral rather than evil. They're very protective of their demesnes and whatever subjects remain to them, however, and attacking a pale sovereign's territory is the swiftest way to draw their ire. If a pale sovereign is ousted from their country's central throne, they retreat to any other holdings they might still possess and rule those.</p>\n<p>The attitudes of a pale sovereign's subjects vary. Many aren't even aware of their ruler's true nature. Among those who know the secret, some value their sovereign's protection and view them fondly. Others are uncomfortable with an undead eternal monarch, especially if the sovereign has become corrupt or bitter.</p>\n<p>A pale sovereign's territory is indelibly marked by their presence. Plants wither and blacken, struggling to grow in dry and lifeless soil. Wild animals often rise as undead unless they receive special ritual burials, leading to packs of skeletal and zombified beasts roaming the territory. Such monsters don't harm the demesne's residents but are quick to attack any intruders not bearing the sovereign's sigil.

If a vetalarana is killed, they can occupy one of these comatose husks, while more powerful vetalaranas can control them like living puppets.</p>\n<p>When a vetalarana is destroyed, all of their comatose victims are immediately freed. Most often, these people regain consciousness as amnesiacs whose memories return over time—taking at least months but sometimes as long as decades. These returned memories are fragmented and often jumbled with the thoughts of others the vetalarana fed upon. If a victim served as a failed host or was frequently controlled while comatose, a sliver of the vetalarana's corrupted thoughts remain in the victim's mind. These tainted victims recover much faster than their fellows, regaining their memories in record time and transforming into a new vetalarana soon after.</p>\n<p>A vetalarana manipulator is a gifted strategist, empowered by the memories, thoughts, and talents the manipulator has drained from countless victims and honed by centuries of survival. Certain of their own superiority, manipulators twist free-willed individuals for their own ends as easily as they control their comatose puppets.</p>",
