			"description": "<p>Hao Jin really has some nerve for a supposed disciple of Abadar. First, she dares to start a collection of trinkets in hopes of emulating the great Abadar's unsurpassable First Vault. As if that weren't enough, she also sets up a contest to give away her most powerful treasures to anyone who can throw a punch! Abadar hasn't directly told you as much, per se, but surely this kind of hubris can't sit well with your beloved deity, regardless of Hao Jin's own supposed ties to the Master of the First Vault. At the very least, someone's got to check out this shoddy imitation of the First Vault and write a report for the church of Abadar - and you've decided that someone is you.</p>\n<p>With or without the blessing of an actual priest of Abadar, you've taken it upon yourself to investigate Hao Jin's \"wondrous\" vault by winning her Ruby Phoenix Tournament. You read a few flyers about the tournament's home city and joined the first team that could handle your righteous zealotry, but any more preparation would be a waste of time. You clearly have the divine will of Abadar on your side (but again, no actual proof of this), which is all you'll need to win this tournament and dispel any notions of Hao Jin's ties to your patron deity.</p>\n<p>选择两项属性提升。一项必须是<strong>魅力</strong>或<strong>感知</strong>，另一项为自选属性提升。</p>\n<p>You're trained in Religion and the Goka Lore skill.

			"description": "<p>The Harbor Guard isn't known for being the most honorable precinct in town. A few years after you joined the force, you became disillusioned by the rampant corruption within the precinct and the district at large. One night, you stumbled on an ad for a local monster hunter's guild. You joined on a whim, but fell in love with the swashbuckling lifestyle of an independent bounty hunter. You've since earned quite a reputation for your nocturnal adventures; everyone still knows that you're a Harbor Guard, but stories of your dungeon-delving adventures have long overshadowed that facet of your life. Unfortunately, long nights of monster-hunting have negatively impacted your performance at your day job, so maybe it wasn't a surprise when your supervising officer put in a transfer request for you, spelling the end of your plucky nighttime antics with that particular guild.</p>\n<p>Despite the decline in your performance, Lieutenant Lavarsus of Edgewatch sees potential (and even, maybe, a bit of himself) in you. You're eager to be on a new unit and for the chance to bring your monster-hunting skills to a district that has been plagued by such supernatural beasts for far too long.</p>\n<p>选择两项属性提升。一项必须是<strong>力量</strong>或<strong>体质</strong>，另一项为自选属性提升。</p>\n<p>You're trained in the Athletics skill and your choice of Sailing Lore or Hunting Lore.
