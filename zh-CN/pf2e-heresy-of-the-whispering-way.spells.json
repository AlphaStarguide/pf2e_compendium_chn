The ritual itself is unique to everyone that performs it, but certain paths hold similarities that shape your ritual. Before performing the ritual, you must select a Lich Path you seek to ascend using; it is henceforth referred to as your path, and changes the requirements for your ritual. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To begin the ritual, you must first perform its Sacrifice, as detailed in your path. This sacrifice often takes a form thematically appropriate to your life and experiences, and rarely needs to be something visually grand. Often, the thing sacrificed is deeply personal and irreplaceable, to the point that its loss may lead to a conflict with your edicts and anathemas. This sacrifice creates a fracture within your soul, allowing the magic of the ritual to begin altering it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the ritual has begun, the ritual must then consume a powerful source of magic, typically an item as listed in the ritual’s cost. This item or source must be of a level equal to or greater than twice the ritual’s level. The item/source is destroyed or drained by the ritual, typically depending on how powerful it is, but does not inherently need to be abhorrent. While many wicked liches may sacrifice a large number of souls to brute force this requirement, a powerful magical item, ley-line, or the blessing of a deity are all equally valid sources for this magical energy. The magical energy provided by this portion of the ritual is used in tandem with your own magic in order to fuel the ascension to lichdom; if it has a trait that matches your lichdom tradition (such as arcane if your spellcasting is arcane), you get a +2 status bonus to the primary check for this ritual.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After this is done and the casting time of the ritual ends, the ritual itself does not conclude. Instead, you have one month to perform the final portion of the ritual: ending your life in a poignant and thematic way as detailed by your path’s ending means. This is by far the most loose portion of ritual, as any number of means and ends can be significant enough to count, and should be discussed with the GM. Should the ritual end before you complete the ending means, the ritual counts as an automatic failure (but not a critical failure), and any items spent are lost. This can be devastating and exceptionally costly, as you will need to provide the sacrifice and the magical source again; however, if you know the ritual was poorly performed, it can provide a method to try again without risking a worse fate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If any of these requirements are absent, improperly performed, or thematically insignificant, it reduces the degree of success for the primary caster’s skill check to complete the ritual by one level for each missing requirement.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Critical Success</strong> As success, but you rejuvenate instantly, appearing over the ritual circle in all your resplendent and necromantic glory.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Success</strong> The ritual succeeds, you are destroyed, and your soul flees to your soul cage (or equivalent).

Because you gained them in this manner, you must select the dedication feat at the next opportunity, either as a class feat or a free archetype feat. If you do not have a physical soul cage, you instead appear at a location important to you 1d10 days later, even if you normally would not return after being destroyed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual fails, you are destroyed, and you are not resurrected. You can still be resurrected by normal means, but may have drawn attention in the afterlife from your failure.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You experience a fate worse than death, becoming a lich shade.
