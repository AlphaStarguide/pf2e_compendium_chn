A Cry for Help</span><span>Low 1</span></h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  After following only faint traces of the Old Coast Road, the approach to Kindred’s Crossing becomes apparent. Here,\n  the road grows more obvious, with portions even retaining old paving stones as it turns south toward a short, rocky\n  peninsula. To the north, a steep, weather-worn ridge of stone rises thirty feet high into the air, featuring an\n  occasional ledge that appears to provide nesting spots for ospreys. To the east, the road rises up from the shoreline\n  to follow a wide ledge that winds around the peninsula. Ahead, near the peninsula’s tip, the road reaches a cleft in\n  the steep shoreline, over which the remains of an old and incomplete wooden bridge stand. Nearby, what appears to be a\n  freshly wrecked rowboat sits upside down among the tide pools.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This short ridge is difficult to clamber over, requiring @Check[athletics|dc:20|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] checks to Climb up and over the ridge, which\n  reaches a height of 30 feet above the roadway along its midpoint.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creatures:</strong> As with the aftermath of any coastal storm, the surging waves left debris along the\n  shoreline of the Kindred Coast. The wrecked rowboat is one such remnant, but so are the creatures that have been\n  uprooted from their homes a bit further out to sea. A reefclaw has been sheltering in the tide pools under the upended\n  boat since being pummeled by the waves. It’s since recovered but has found that it enjoys its new home and has no\n  intention of leaving. This has bothered the haniver gremlin who thinks of the wreck as rightfully their own, as they\n  spent days stalking the ship from which the rowboat was lost during the storm. The haniver’s last two attempts to run\n  off the reefclaw resulted in frightening near pinches, and they’re not eager for a third confrontation with the snippy\n  creature.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <div class=\"encounter-image-wrapper\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/tokens/Haniver%20Gremlin.webp\" />\n    </div>\n\t<h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">A Cry for Help</span>\n\t<span class=\"keepme\">Low 1</span></h2>\n\t<span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.2gOOtPSWXJtql8i2]{Haniver} @UUID[Actor.Y133Sx0joIm2DZ3g]{Reefclaw}</span>\n  </div>\n<p>\n  As the PCs approach this area, the haniver sees a fun new opportunity.

Any PC who investigates quickly annoys the territorial reefclaw, which slithers out to attack, much\n  to the haniver’s delight. The gremlin begins cackling and splashing about in their tide pool as a fight begins between\n  the PCs and the reefclaw.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The reefclaw flees back to open waters if reduced to fewer than 6 Hit Points. The haniver then moves in to attack the\n  PCs, hoping to steal shiny things from them and scare them off from “their” boat now that they’ve been softened up by\n  reefclaw pinches. The haniver shrieks in pain and tries to swim away as well if reduced to fewer than 3 Hit Points.\n</p>\n</section>\n<p>\n<strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.LcAFMhy6wasCBxDQ]{Waterproof Leather Bag}<br />\n  The rowboat, once a lifeboat for a pirate ship that sunk during the storm, has a small\n  stash of treasure tucked into a waterproof leather bag that was stuffed into a cabinet under a seat.

The Old Bridge</h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  Two weatherworn stone statues stand on either side of a fifteen-foot-wide rift in the shore, extending their arms\n  toward one another. A partially completed, partially eroded old stone bridge doesn’t quite cross the gulf. In the\n  water fifteen feet below, the surf crashes on a worn wedge of stone that might have at one time been part of the\n  bridge.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When Santwi and Dartanious agreed to work together and build the Coast Road (now the Old Coast Road), they began work\n  on a stone bridge over a gap in the natural stone of the peninsula. This bridge originally featured four stone\n  pillars, two which were carved to resemble Santwi and Dartanious holding the top of the bridge’s railing and facing\n  out towards the water. Over the last century, erosion has marred the faces of these statues clean.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For many years, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2]{Osprey Cove} attempted to keep the bridge in good repair, but the town has generally ignored it for the\n  past decade. A wooden bridge replacement was scavenged long ago by @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2]{Iron Harbor} for use in building roofs and ships.\n  When Blanton reached this location on his desperate journey to Osprey Cove, he was pursued by a pair of deros sent by\n  the cult to prevent him from reaching his destination, and in a desperate gambit he leapt into the sea on the southern\n  side and swam through the surf to the northern gap. This conflict took place at sunrise, so the dero had no choice but\n  to retreat to area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02shelteredled00]{A3}. Exhausted from his sickness, the two poisoned bolt strikes he suffered, and the harrowing swim,\n  it took Blanton the rest of the day to stagger his way to Osprey Cove.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This area acts as a skill challenge to test the PCs’ creativity and ingenuity to find a way across. The most likely\n  solutions are summarized below—each skill check made to cross the gap should be a DC 15 check (unless the attempt is\n  particularly dangerous, such as tightrope walking).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Climbing and Swimming:</strong> A PC can Climb 15 feet down to the water, then Swim across the 5-foot-wide,\n  10-foot-deep tide pool, then Climb 15 feet back up on the opposite side. A PC could also Climb around the northeastern\n  edge of the gap, avoiding the water entirely, but doing so takes longer. The water is deep enough that a 15-foot-fall\n  inflicts no damage; a character can halt a fall by Grabbing an Edge with a @Check[reflex|dc:15|traits:manipulate,action:grab-an-edge|name:Grab an Edge] save.<br />\n  Skill checks: @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] to Climb, @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:swim|name:Swim] to Swim\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Jumping:</strong> A PC can attempt a Long Jump to cross the ravine at its narrowest point near the steep\n  northern ridge. Doing so requires the PC to cover the 15-foot gap with a @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:long-jump|name:Long Jump] check (and at least 10 feet\n  of distance covered before the Long Jump is attempted). A PC whose Speed is at least 30 feet can cover the gap\n  automatically with a single Leap.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Using a Rope:</strong> The PCs can throw a lasso or a grappling hook over the far statue, pull the rope tight,\n  and then anchor the near side of the rope to the adjacent statue. Anchoring the rope is a secret ranged attack roll\n  using the PC’s highest proficiency against AC 20 (on a critical failure, the grappling hook or lasso appears to be\n  anchored, but pulls free once a PC is halfway across). Using a rope tied in this way allows a PC to cross the gap by\n  clambering and clinging to the rope with a @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] check or a @Check[acrobatics|dc:30|traits:move,skill,action:balance|name:Balance] check to Balance as they tightrope\n  walk across the gap.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.tO46DP0MnaEzL54l]{Wooden Post}<br />\n  On the eastern side of the bridge, a single bolt from a hand crossbow is embedded in a\n  wooden post near the bridgeworks. An examination of the bolt confirms it to be the same size capable of inflicting the\n  wound found on Blanton’s body, and if it’s extracted from the pole and examined, tiny traces of giant centipede venom\n  that remained on the bolt (and avoided being washed away by the rain as a result of being lodged in the wood) can be\n  identified with a successful @Check[crafting|dc:15|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,skill,action:identify-alchemy|name:Identify Alchemy] check to Identify Alchemy.\n</p>\n<p><strong>Reward:</strong> Grant the PCs 40 XP for getting past the broken bridge.</p>"

He wasn’t so lucky, and a pair of deros who work for the\n  cult of Xar-Azmak were sent in pursuit of him. The deros and their trained giant centipedes caught up to Blanton just\n  before sunrise as he was taking stock of the bridge at area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02theoldbridge00]{The Old Bridge}. The deros opened fire on him, and he got off a few\n  shots from his shortbow, wounding both of them before his bowstring broke. Desperate, Blanton leapt into the sea. With\n  the sun rising in minutes and not eager to follow Blanton’s plunge, the two deros retreated to this ledge, but even\n  pressed against the far wall they were forced to endure six hours of painful burns from exposure to sunlight. One of\n  the two dero perished before the storm rolled in and blocked the sunlight enough to save the surviving dero, who had\n  fallen unconscious from her wounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This dero, Sydri, woke from unconsciousness in the dead of night at the height of the storm. Astounded by the wrath of\n  the surface world’s weather and unsure of how many hours she had until the next sunrise, she left the safety of her\n  ledge long enough to gather up several boughs and clumps of shrubbery. By the time the sun rose again, she was able to\n  retreat into near darkness under a shelter made of the shrubbery, with her dead companion’s clothing draped over the\n  framework. Her plan is to wait for nightfall before making her way back to Iron Harbor, but when the PCs pass by on\n  the road below that afternoon, she can’t resist the urge to attack them, reasoning that even if they aren’t going to\n  investigate Iron Harbor, at least they might have food and supplies to help her recover from her near-death\n  experience.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <div class=\"encounter-image-wrapper\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1.5)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/tokens/Sydri.webp\" />\n    </div>\n\t<h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Sheltered Ledge</span>\n\t<span class=\"keepme\">Moderate 1</span></h2>\n\t<span class=\"link\">@UUID[Actor.0qGYozu96uCyqwwv]{Sydri} @UUID[Actor.ShWcSAzHjKnQ8MJX]{Giant Centipedes (2)}</span>\n  </div>\n<p>\n  Once the fight begins, Sydri remains up on her ledge, unwilling to climb down into the direct sunlight (although\n  unless the battle takes an hour, she won’t take further damage from exposure to the sun). She commands her pet giant\n  centipedes to clamber down to attack the PCs while she continues firing on them with her hand crossbow. She switches\n  to her aklys if a PC attempts to scramble up to her ledge, attempting to trip them. Sydri fights to the death, but if\n  captured alive and the PCs can establish communication with her (note she only speaks Aklo and Undercommon), she’s\n  willing to trade information for her release, but even then she’s misleading as she doesn’t wish to reveal much about\n  her cult allies. She attempts to Lie to the PCs, fabricating a story about how she and her companion (nodding her head\n  to the badly sunlight-burned, naked, dead dero slumped against the back wall of the overhung ledge) emerged into the\n  surface world from a narrow fissure up higher in the ridge, then attacked a man who passed by on the road, intending\n  to capture him alive and drag him back down to the dark for experimentation on to how he could withstand the sun’s\n  light. If confronted with her lies, she grows quiet and sullen and speaks no more—taking her first chance to escape,\n  even if it means fleeing through the sunlight. It’s likely only through magic, like <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm}</em>, that the PCs will be able\n  to make Sydri helpful, at which point what she might have to reveal to the PCs is up to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Note that Sydri’s weak condition is the result of her wounds and exposure to too much sunlight.

While the total number of guards in Stonehome doesn’t change, it’s certainly possible for\n  the PCs to encounter them in larger or smaller groups than those presented here. During play, make sure to keep an eye\n  on encounters’ changing threat as guards move about and join fights, using the guidelines on page 489 of the Core\n  Rulebook as an aid.\n</p>\n</aside>\n<p>\n  The Gorumite temple of Stonehome is difficult to approach from the ground as the front gate is locked tight and sharp\n  iron spikes deter folks from climbing the fence. No less than five @Check[thievery|dc:25|traits:manipulate,skill,action:pick-a-lock|name:Pick a Lock] checks are required to Pick the Lock\n  at the front gate. A @Check[athletics|dc:30|traits:attack,skill,action:force-open|name:Force Open] check is required to Force Open the sturdy gate. The spiked wall is 20 feet high,\n  and while it’s only a @Check[athletics|dc:20|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb] check to Climb it, the spikes are both difficult terrain and hazardous terrain\n  that inflicts [[/r 4d6[piercing]]] damage (@Check[reflex|dc:20|basic:true] save) each time a creature attempts to climb through them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  However, there are three safer routes into the compound, each of which can be revealed to the PCs by one of three\n  potential sources in Iron Harbor—each of whom also asks the PCs for a specific favor once they get inside Stonehome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Derrol:</strong> As an architect, Derrol has insight into the structure. He shares that it’s well defended\n  from the ground but neglects defense from above. Stonehome’s position nestled within a steep nook in the cliffside\n  leaves it open to infiltration from above. Derrol can point out the safest route up the cliffs to a narrow ledge that\n  sits 20 feet over the rooftop (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02rooftoprange00]{C19}). Without his aid, a PC who spends 4 hours Investigating the area surrounding\n  Stonehome can spot this route with a @Check[architecture-lore|dc:15] or a @Check[perception|dc:20] check. The route can be made\n  without any Athletics checks to climb until that last 20 feet, when a @Check[athletics|dc:15|traits:move,skill,action:climb|name:Climb]{Climb} check is required to scale the cliff\n  down to a point where a character can safely step off onto the rooftop. Note that if the PCs make this approach\n  without being stealthy, the occupants of the roof and possibly the dueling balcony (areas @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02rooftoprange00]{C19} and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02duelingbalco00]{C14}, respectively)\n  are likely to notice them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Elsie:</strong> Before Stonehome locked down, Elsie had been paying daily visits to the stables (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02stables0000000]{C2}) to\n  nurse one of the temple’s rosethorn rams back to health. She tells the PCs she’s concerned that the animal has been\n  suffering this past week without medication—if the poor thing is even still alive. She gives the PCs a biscuit-shaped\n  dose of medicine to feed to Ida the rosethorn, but she also indicates that if the PCs can rescue her and bring her\n  back to Elsie, that would be even better. She’s never been in the structure itself, but on her many trips through the\n  courtyard, she noticed the small well on the opposite side of the yard from the stables. She suspects that the well\n  connects to an underground stream that empties into Iron Harbor just east of town, and can direct the PCs to this\n  location (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02streamoutlet00]{B8}).\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Janis:</strong> Worried for her captain, Janis asks the PCs to infiltrate Stonehome and rescue him—or at least\n  bring word of his fate (with his distinctive hat as evidence) if he’s beyond rescue. She’s spent some time studying\n  Stonehome from afar through a spyglass and warns the PCs against attempts to climb the spiked walls, but she gives\n  them a possible alternate way to enter the well-defended structure. Every sunrise and sunset, the guard posted at the\n  edge of town changes. Two nights ago, Janis crept up to the guard who stood watch at the edge of town and pickpocketed\n  their key. She stole away, made a quick impression of it in wax, and then managed to return the key to the guard’s\n  belt without them noticing. While she hasn’t yet had the chance to put the mold to use (in part because she worries\n  about leaving the <em>Swordfish</em> for the amount of time an infiltration would require), she’ll entrust the mold to the PCs\n  if they agree to help find her captain. With the mold and an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.y34yjumCFakrbtdw]{Artisan's Toolkit} (which can be purchased in town for\n  4 gp), an hour’s work and a @Check[crafting|dc:15] check can create a new key capable of unlocking the front gate.\n</p>"

But above all, be discreet!”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once she’s had her say, Ordwi smiles and calls Sister Vanda over again, and with a final nod to the PCs, the pair head\n  off toward @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02stonehome00001]{Stonehome}, leaving the party to themselves. After Elder Ordwi leaves the PCs, it’s up to them what to do\n  next. Iron Harbor is not a large village, but there are several areas of interest they could investigate.

She’s open\n  during daylight hours, usually while she’s working on one project or another, and closes an hour past sundown in the\n  evenings. When she’s closed, she’s often away from her shop, speaking with the locals or one of her many cousins that\n  live in town. Regardless, the first time the PCs approach the building, Elsie is within. When the PCs enter, read the\n  following.\n</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  The main room of this building smells of baked goods and strange, bitter odors one might expect in an apothecary’s\n  shop. The room’s decor seems undecided about whether it wants to be a tavern, a curio shop, or an alchemist’s\n  laboratory. The low shelves that line the walls display a staggering mix of elixirs, unguents, jars of glue,\n  fresh-baked goods, cutlery, mugs, and the occasional smokestick or bundle of tindertwigs.\n</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/art/pzo9564%20elsie.webp\" alt=\"halfling woman with a large blond braid and blue eyes wearing a brown leather apron\" title=\"Elsie\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/art/pzo9564%20elsie.webp')\" />\n<p>\n  Moments later, a skinny halfling emerges from the back room to greet the PCs—Elsie (CN female halfling alchemist 3)\n  herself. “Oh! You’re new, ain’tcha? Where you come from them? You here from that fancy ship, or did another weird ship\n  come floatin’ in when I wasn’t lookin’?” Below are some of the PCs’ likely inquiries and Elsie’s responses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>We’re from</strong>\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2]{Osprey Cove}. “Nah,\n  can’t be. They haven’t talked to us in ages. Too busy being stuck up and being part of a cooperative commune and\n  talking to birds or whatever.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>No, really, we’re from Osprey Cove.</strong> “Well, nobody’s perfect. Did you get yourself run out of town for\n  being bad bird farmers or somethin’?”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Do you know Blanton?</strong> “Not really. One of them Gorumites. I’ve seen him about town, but less so since\n  them Thassilonians showed up.” (If the PCs reveal what became of Blanton, Elsie is startled and might even think the\n  PCs are trying to trick her.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Do you know Vanda?</strong> “Name doesn’t ring a bell.” (If the PCs reveal she’s the guard they met at the\n  edge of town, Elsie shrugs, noting, “It’s hard to get to know—much less learn the names of—most of the Gorumites. They\n  do love their armor, after all!”)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you sell?</strong> “Lots’a things alchemical, but mostly glues for ship making and dyes for just about\n  anything. I have a healthy stock of medicine too. And baked goods too, of course, although those are best in the\n  morning when they’re fresh out of the oven.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you know about</strong>\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03rusthenge00000]{Rusthenge}? “Bunch of twisted, rusty metal\n  spires left here a millennia or four ago. Basically useless, although works well I hear as a landmark when you’re\n  headin’ home from a day at sea. If you’re thinking of heading up there, fair warning—place kinda makes some folks\n  sick. I’ve got a few doses of my special brew on hand for you if you’re thinking of going up there, provided you’ll\n  pay for it, of course!” (This “special brew” is \n  @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.SrjykpB3nEAQmgj5]{Elsie's Excellent Bottled Vim}, a concoction that will be\n  quite helpful once the PCs begin to explore Rusthenge.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Are there any troubles in town? Any sicknesses spreading?</strong> “Nope. Apart from those Thassilonians that\n  came in a week ago and then shacked up in\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02stonehome00001]{Stonehome}, things have been fine hereabouts\n  lately. No strange sickness spreading that I know about. Wait. Should I know about something?” (If the PCs describe\n  Blanton’s symptoms, she sighs in relief and reports that no one in town’s had anything close to that—not even those\n  who get sick from visiting the spires in the first place.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Can you tell us about Stonehome?</strong> “Place is run by the Gorumites. Not my deal, but I appreciate the\n  stability they bring. They like to fight and think the best person at fighting is the best person to be in charge.\n  Seems weird to me, but it’s not my religion. Place has been quiet for the last week, though, ever since them\n  Thassilonians showed up. Fine with me. Fewer Gorumites on the street means less clanking armor and, more importantly,\n  less noisy praying. But still—it’s not normal for them to be shut in this long.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What’s with the ship in the harbor?</strong> “That Thassilonian thing? Belongs to a merchant, I hear. He and\n  his entourage have been spending the last week in talks up at Stonehome. Who knows what they’re up to, but I’ve seen\n  that there’s still some crew on the ship itself. None of ’em have come in to buy anything yet, which is just rude!”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Could we stay the night here?</strong> “Figured we’d get here sooner or later. One of these days, someone’ll\n  have to build a proper inn here in town, but in the meantime... Inn the meantime... get it? Ummm... Yeah. I can help\n  you out.” Elsie ushers the PCs to the largest table, telling them she’ll bring out dinner momentarily before bustling\n  into the back room. She returns a few moments later with a tray of individual and delicious (but cold) grouse pies.\n  During this time, she’ll continue to answer questions. She doesn’t charge for the meal, but asks for a payment of 5 sp\n  per night the PCs wish to sleep on her floor.\n</p>"

Each of these aristocrats represented a\n    different affluent family from Magnimar: the Mindurians, the Valdemars, and the Vanderales; they hoped to develop a new settlement far north of Varisia’s Lost\n  Coast. Construction of the three manors began at once, but the buildings weren’t quite complete before disaster struck\n  Magnimar in the form of a devastating tsunami. Suddenly, protecting and repairing assets closer to home became a more\n  important way to spend money and resources for these three aristocrats, and they abandoned their so-called “Chakikoth\n  Project,” never to return. The three partially completed manors have been left ever since to slowly fall into ruin.\n  The locals have since taken to calling the small compound of ruined mansions “Gold’s Ruin.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Within the three manors, there’s little to find other than musty and ruined furniture, seabird nests in the rafters,\n  vermin nests below the floorboards, and half-finished houses direly in need of repair. The western manor (once a\n  Mindurian project) is little more than a foundation, while the eastern manor (funded by the Vanderales) is partially\n  collapsed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The central and smallest manor is the soundest of the trio, and while it includes a mostly leak-free roof, its\n  interior walls are nothing more than a framework. This was the project of the Valdemars, and as the soundest remaining\n  structure in Gold’s Ruin, has also been the home of a man named <strong>Derrol Finnick</strong> (CN male human architect 3) ever since\n  the aristocrats abandoned the site. A 58-year-old man and a former architect from Magnimar, Derrol came to Iron Harbor\n  with the Valdemars, but after a dispute about his pay, he abandoned his patron and attempted to move into Iron Harbor.\n  By the time he realized how ill a fit he was among a town of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.88vRw2ZVPax4hhga]{Gorum} worshippers, his patron had left. He took up\n  residence in the half-built manor, and after an ill-fated attempt to travel to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02optionalstar00#osprey-covesettlement-2]{Osprey Cove} met with a close call when\n  attempting to cross the fallen bridge at @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02kindredcross00]{Kindred Crossing}, he’s settled into a life in the ruins. Here, he’s managed a\n  somewhat happy existence fishing and foraging for his food while living in the abandoned Valdemar estate. Derrol\n  remains friendly and is eager for conversation, and if the PCs enter the manor, he quickly greets them.\n</p>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  “Derrol’s the name! Derrol Finnick. Used to be—well, used to be a lot of things, but most recently an underpaid\n  architect and now just Derrol. These are my houses! The rest of the town doesn’t like them because they think they’re\n  haunted, but I don’t mind. Ghosts never bothered me much, and there’s plenty of space. Not many visit Iron Harbor, but\n  here you are! What can ol’ Derrol do for you?”\n</p>\n<p>\n  As an outsider to the village, but one who still considers himself part of Iron Harbor on some level, Derrol can give\n  the PCs a fair bit of additional information.

Probably more to my liking than this place, from what I’ve\n  heard. Iron Harbor’s got a tough name and tougher people, and it’s not really for me. I tried being tough and failed;\n  I’d rather just fish and make art.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How’d you end up here?</strong> “I came in some years back with the Valdemars, but I got fed up with not getting paid my due.\n  By the time I realized that the locals nearby are even less pleasant, the Valdemars had left me behind. Just been\n  spending my time here since then—I guess they kind of forgot me. Now I just fish and explore and sometimes make little\n  sculptures and carvings.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Do you know Blanton?</strong> “Nope. Name’s familiar, but... it’s been a while since I’ve been welcome in the village, and a\n  lot of names have sorta run together in my head over the years.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What can you tell us about Stonehome?</strong> “Place is old, that’s for sure. Well, the lower portion is, at least. Upper\n  works are pretty new, and not nearly so well made. Gorum’s not a god of architecture, but I suppose it works well\n  enough for them. Interesting place though! I’ve long wondered about the interior...” (If he learns the PCs intend to\n  infiltrate Stonehome, Derrol has some advice on how they can get into the structure if they promise to map out the\n  interior for him; see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02enteringston00]{Entering Stonehome}.)\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Do you know anything about a sickness or curse in the area?</strong> “They’ve always said @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03rusthenge00000]{Rusthenge} is cursed, but I think it’s\n  just old and useless. No one needs an old metal monument of twisted rusty metal. Instead of saying ‘there’s a bunch of\n  junk on that island,’ they say it’s cursed.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you know about the ship in the harbor?</strong> “Showed up about a week ago, and a delegation of Gorumites met them at\n  the pier. I watched it from the cliff until they all headed up to Stonehome, and for the most part they haven’t come\n  back out yet. Although I’ve been keeping an eye on them after dark on the nights when it’s not too stormy. Saw them\n  unload a big crate from the ship in the middle of the night, but they carted it up to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02thunderheadi00]{Thunderhead Isle} instead of\n  bringing it onto the mainland. And I’ve seen some weird lights up there too a few nights.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Tell us more about Thunderhead Isle/Rusthenge.</strong> “I stay away from the place—went there once years back and felt like I\n  was being watched; that was enough for me! But lately, I’ve been seeing weird lights up there late at night. Nothing\n  bright. Thought I was imagining it the first time. And I doubt you can see them at all from down in the village. But\n  up here, on this cliff, you’ve got a better view of Rusthenge, and yeah. Weird lights.

He’s tired of\n  living alone and wants to get back to village life “where the people are more friendly.” In an attempt to sweeten the\n  deal, he offers the PCs a “bit o’ treasure I may have nicked from boss Valdemar once it became apparent he wasn’t\n  gonna pay me what I was worth.” This is a tiny brass key set with small gemstones. The key doesn’t open any locks on\n  the isle but is worth 20 gp.

Several of my\n    kin doubled over in pain—it looked as if their skin was rusting—and Lord Ragnulf ordered the rest of us to ‘put down\n    the blasphemers’.

During the day’s low tides (a\n    one-hour window that starts at 6:00 am and then again at 6:00 pm), one can walk along the southern peninsula through tide pools and exposed rocks, but at all other times the\n  only way to reach the isle is to swim or sail. The PCs can use the rowboat found at @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02fisherspoint00]{Fisher’s Point} to reach the isle.\n  Once the villagers know what’s at stake, the PCs can ask one of the local fishers to transport them out on one of\n  their boats, but in that case the rowboat won’t be available for a quick getaway—the PCs will need to arrange a\n  schedule or signal to let the fishers know they need to be picked up.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most of the isle’s shoreline is made up of sheer, 50-foot-high cliffs, but the eastern shore slopes more gently down\n  to the ocean. It’s a short hike up through dry grass and stunted trees to the isle’s center where the ruins of\n  Rusthenge itself await. Once a place of harnessing sinful soul energy by sacrificing envious creatures in the center\n  pit, Rusthenge has lain dormant for thousands of years. Originally, the spires themselves rose hundreds of feet into\n  the air, and the place was known as the Vloric Spires.\n</p>\n<p>As the PCs approach, read the following.</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    At the isle’s crown is a broad, flat field, its southern edge dropping away to the waves below, affording a\n    magnificent view of the sea, while to the north, a craggy ridge of barren rock blocks the view of Iron Harbor. In a\n    circle just north of the cliff’s edge rise seven jagged spires of rusted metal, each reaching over fifty feet into\n    the sky. Within this circle of ancient iron stand seven rock formations that may have at one time been sculptures\n    but now are little more than weathered chunks of stone and piles of rubble. At the center, a seven-sided pit drops a\n    few feet into a heap of boulders, stones, and other scree, among which stubborn shoots of grass or small shrubs grow\n    fitfully.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A fifteen-foot-by-twenty-foot canvas tent has been erected between two of the metal spires on the western side.\n    Nearby is a sizable wooden crate, its east side open to reveal an interior strewn with red-stained straw. Freshly\n    dug channels through the thin soil connect two of the smaller stone sculptures and the pit at the center—these\n    channels appear to have been soaked in blood.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  The seven ruined rock formations within the ring of iron spires were once sculptures of the seven runes of sin used by\n  Thassilonian wizards—a PC who spends a few minutes examining the site can recognize these shapes with a successful @Check[arcana|dc:20] or an appropriate Lore check, like @Check[xin-edasseril-lore|dc:20].\n</p>\n<p>\n  Ever since the cultists of Xar-Azmak returned to the site, they’ve been conducting experiments in attempts to restart\n  the old magic once capable of harvesting soul energies, hopeful this will help in the ritual Meitremar has been\n  working on to resurrect the dead demon lord. Evidence of their attempts exists in a freshly dug channel between the\n  central pit and two of the old rune sculptures, but also in the strange lights some folks have witnessed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A stairway down into the chambers below has remained hidden here for thousands of years, covered by a thick layer of\n  soil and debris over the entrance and unguessed at by the locals. The first night the cultists visited the site\n  (several days before the PCs’ arrival in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06402messag.JournalEntryPage.02ironharbor0000#iron-harborsettlement-2]{Iron Harbor}), they uncovered this hidden stairwell and erected a tent over\n  it, but before the PCs can explore this flight of spiral stairs, they’ll need to contend with the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03sacrificekee00]{\"Sacrifice Keepers\"}\n  who stand vigil here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finally, the Vloric Spires themselves exude a subtle, unsettling aura that tends to make those who step into the\n  circle of spires feel unpleasant.

Connections to the Darklands below have allowed numerous creatures to filter up into the\n  complex, including two factions whose temperaments made alliances easy—a small group of deros and a larger group of\n  albino boggards. While Meitremar managed to secure something akin to an alliance with the deros, the boggards have\n  been a bit more standoffish. Rather than waste resources trying to fight them, though, Meitremar’s ordered the\n  cultists to simply ignore the boggards for now—once Xar-Azmak is raised, they’ll have plenty of time to “clean house.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  These boggards, who refer to themselves as the Children of the Black Lake, are natives to the Darklands and have the\n  pale countenances to match. Known to some as “deep boggards,” these creatures’ slightly phosphorescent pale green\n  flesh gives them an almost ghostly look, but apart from this they’re quite similar to their surface-dwelling\n  kin—though the Black Lake boggards have no idea that others like them dwell in the world above. The boggards have been\n  idly looting the ruins below Rusthenge for weeks, bringing their choicest treasures to Gurga in the “dripping room”\n  (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03drippingroom00]{D10}). When Meitremar and his cultists arrived, the boggards chose to barricade themselves and their treasures\n  into this part of the complex. They’ve sent scouts out to search for a safe path back to the Black Lake (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06404ressur.JournalEntryPage.04theblacklake00]{F10}) but\n  have yet to hear word back. Now the boggards are waiting for the humans to leave so they can return home.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Only two boggards remain in this room. These two scouts, Bolgus and Durgon, spend their time sorting the items they’ve\n  salvaged from the workshop and cleaning the grime from them. They’re paranoid about the invading humans them and act\n  unfriendly toward any non-boggards who enter the room. A PC can convince the boggards they mean no harm with a\n  successful @Check[diplomacy|dc:18|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression] check to Make an Impression. If the boggards are made indifferent, they call their boss,\n  Gurga, to pass judgment. Once Gurga arrives from the dripping room (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03drippingroom00]{D10}), a PC must Make an Impression on her\n  with a successful @Check[diplomacy|dc:20|traits:action:make-an-impression|name:Make an Impression] check to earn her trust.

These badges are constructed from a chip of stone, glowing mushrooms, rodent teeth, and a sticky\n  brown substance that might be mud. Visibly wearing the resulting “badge” can help prevent other Black Lake boggards\n  from attacking them.

Research Lab</span><span>Severe 2</span></h2>\n<p class=\"read-aloud\">\n  Torches illuminate this fifteen-foot-high chamber. A pair of massive columns of rusted metal loom in large alcoves to\n  the east and south, each fitted with complex hinged armatures and drooping lengths of wire that connect them to one of\n  two large metallic worktables. Gears grind slowly and glowing crystals periodically pulse from these worktables. A\n  stone well ten feet in diameter stands in the center of the room between the two strange worktables, capped with a\n  stone slab engraved with a singular broad rune with three downward spikes. Bookshelves line the northern wall, though\n  most of their contents have fallen to ruin—save for one faded red tome near the center of the northern wall.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In this laboratory, Theiltemar conducted his experiments on skymetal for Belimarius’s approval. A PC who’s visited the\n  aboveground ruins of Rusthenge immediately recognizes the two rusted metal columns as being identical in shape—indeed,\n  these long spires of rust are the roots of the surface ruin’s southeastern spires. The loops of wires and armatures\n  connect the spires to the magical worktables, allowing spellcasters to adjust and direct the energies gathered by the\n  spires for various purposes. A PC who examines the apparatuses here and succeeds at a @Check[arcana|dc:20|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,action:identify-magic|name:Identify Magic] check to Identify\n  Magic can tell that the spires are a sort of magical “battery,” and the workbenches are meant to help focus the\n  energies; this success also allows the PC to deactivate a workbench as an Interact action. The workbenches have AC 18,\n  Hardness 9, and 36 Hit Points (BT 18).\n</p>\n<p>\n  The stone-capped well is one of several attempts by Belimarius’s agents to create a working <em>runewell</em> (a magical\n  artifact capable of creating hidden demiplanes and storing vast amounts of magic) for the envious runelord, yet like\n  all such attempts it never achieved this level of power. What the well does do is capture fleeting amounts of soul\n  energy from creatures sacrificed at the center of the Vloric Spires above, then converts that energy into distilled\n  envy. Theiltemar had many uses for this glowing liquid in his experiments, but when Earthfall struck, Theiltemar and\n  his followers capped off the envy basin with a large stone slab, hoping to preserve the power within for later use and\n  drastically underestimating the world-changing nature of the cataclysm. Of course, Theiltemar and his cultists never\n  returned to this lab.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While the stone slab was once much stronger, it has weakened after thousands of years of exposure to the lingering\n  energies of Xar-Azmak’s faith. It has AC 15, Hardness 7, and 28 Hit Points (BT 14). If it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.6dNUvdb1dhToNDj3]{Broken} condition,\n  cracks in the stone become large enough to release the primordial envy sealed within (see Creatures). Alternatively, a\n  PC who succeeds at a @Check[athletics|dc:20|traits:attack,skill,action:force-open|name:Force Open] check can Force Open the well by sliding the stone cap to the side.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The faded red tome on the northern shelves is made of wood and bound with leather, as a real book might be. When this\n  library was full, it was well hidden, but it’s now quite conspicuous. Pulling on the book activates a hidden lever\n  that opens the secret door behind the bookcase.

To the west, a massive\n  fifteen-foot-wide iron door seals the passage beyond; sharp spikes and blades of rusted metal cover the entire surface\n  of the door.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Theiltemar commissioned a famous Thassilonian artist from Cyrusian to create these works of art, then sacrificed her\n  to Xar-Azmak. He consecrated the massive iron door with his own blood and a prayer to his master, which corrupted the\n  door and warped it, drawing spikes and blades forth from the iron. Theiltemar’s dried blood is still spattered across\n  the door, the catalyst for the oxidation process.\n</p>\n<p>\n  From left to right, the first fresco shows a figure covered in full plate donning a rusted helm that seems to spread\n  its rusted decay to the rest of his armor. The second fresco shows the figure underwater, walking among crumbling\n  coral and battling a three-eyed fish-like creature with several long tentacles, his rusty armor forming an orange\n  cloud in the water. The third fresco depicts the figure standing in a wheat field, decay and rot spreading from his\n  rusty form as he battles an antler-headed man and a leaf-crowned woman, both covered in boils. The fourth fresco shows\n  the rusted warrior standing on a violet stone mesa with islands of multi-colored stone floating in the background;\n  angels and devils work together to fight him, but his mighty, rusted mace shatters their bodies and withers their\n  flesh. In the fifth fresco, he marches through an infernal city, toppling jagged towers by rusting their foundations\n  and turning all he touches to ruin; a quad-horned devil cries out in anguish in the background.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Finally, in the sixth fresco, a beam of red-brown light falls on a raised stone dais, surrounded by black robed\n  figures in supplication. A single black-robed figure stands in the foreground, arms raised in praise, as the souls of\n  the supplicants swirl out of their bodies and around a single rusted horn, seemingly broken from the rusted warrior’s\n  helm. A shadow seems to grow from the horn, forming the silhouette of a warrior clad in full plate armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The immense door to the west may look too heavy or too rusted to move, yet it swings open with unnatural silence at a\n  touch.

Glowing red gemstones sit in the eye sockets of the looming statue.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Theiltemar built this room as a symbol of his promise to help his lord slay Dispater in vengeance once Xar-Azmak has\n  returned to life. The immense statue depicts Xar-Azmak holding Dispater’s severed head. The PCs can automatically\n  recognize the statue as the same rust-clad demon in the murals in the grand gallery (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06404ressur.JournalEntryPage.04grandgallery00]{Grand Gallery}) and can identify the\n  head as being Dispater’s with a successful @Check[religion|dc:20|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge. The columns depict several types\n  of well-known demons, but each also includes a depiction of a single Vloriak demon. A @Check[religion|dc:20|traits:concentrate,secret,skill,action:recall-knowledge|name:Recall Knowledge] check\n  to Recall Knowledge is enough to recognize the images of abrikandilu demons, babau demons, vrock demons, and marilith\n  demons, but only on a critical success can a PC identify the vloriak and recognize its significance to\n  Xar-Azmak—otherwise the insectile, six-armed demon will, for now, remain a mystery.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe jagged stump on the statue’s head is where the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06405advent.JournalEntryPage.05thehornofrus00]{Horn of Rust}</em> sat for thousands of years before Meitremar arrived\n  and claimed it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The secret door behind the Xar-Azmak statue can be discovered with a successful @Check[perception|dc:25|traits:concentrate,exploration,secret,action:search|name:Search] check by a Searching\n  PC, but a character who knows about the door after reading Meitremar’s journal can find the secret door automatically\n  after Searching for 1 minute.

The ritual is intended to resurrect the demon lord Xar-Azmak,\n  but despite Meitremar’s zealous attention to detail, he simply lacks the power his grandfather possessed at the height\n  of his life. As a result, this attempt is doomed to partial failure at best, but even though he won’t be able to\n  resurrect Xar-Azmak at this time, if the PCs don’t stop him, the results of this ritual could well set into motion a\n  series of events that all but guarantee the demon lord’s eventual return to life.\n</p>\n<p>To help empower this ritual, Meitremar draws upon six sources of external energy: the interaction of\n  the Vloric Spires as the Vlorian cythnigot on the surface constantly attempts to feed from the spires (@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03sacrificekee00]{Sacrifice Keepers}); the\n  demonic energy gathered and stored by the ancient apparatus at the grand altar (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03grandaltar0000]{D3}); the torment of an Abyssal\n  petitioner within the ritual room (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03ritualroom0000]{D13}); the sinister energies gathered and processed in the research lab (area\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03researchlab000]{D20}) and the secret lab (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06403therus.JournalEntryPage.03secretlab00000]{D21}); and the focusing gems found in the eyes of the statue of Xar-Azmak in the worship\n  chamber (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06404ressur.JournalEntryPage.04worshipchamb00]{E5}). The PCs can gain up to 6 Disruption Points from these locations, but even if all are disrupted,\n  Meitremar’s progress on the ritual continues.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once the <em>wall of force</em> comes down, the sound of the ritual becomes apparent as the four cultists chant prayers of\n  adulation to Xar-Azmak. Each time Meitremar blows the <em>Horn of Rust</em>, a low rumbling sound, like old metal grinding\n  against stone, fills the room. Motes of dust on the floor dance and shudder from the vibrations, and teeth ache in\n  their sockets. The horn’s sound is more than unpleasant; it feels almost diseased.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The dead body on the floor was one of Meitremar’s cultists—a man he arbitrarily selected as a sacrifice at the start\n  of the rite to get things started.\n</p>\n<section class=\"encounter\">\n  <div class=\"header\">\n    <div class=\"encounter-image-wrapper\">\n    <img style=\"transform:scale(1)\" src=\"modules/pf2e-rusthenge/assets/art/mm_logo_blue.svg\" />\n    </div>\n\t<h2 class=\"split no-toc\"><span class=\"keepme\">Summoning Chamber</span>\n\t<span class=\"keepme\">Varies 3</span></h2>\n  <span class=\"link\">@UUID[Macro.U92Yu8YJE5rXY9HM]{Summon Fiend}</span>\n  </div>\n<p>\n  <strong>Creatures:</strong> Meitremar and his three cultists continue their ritual even once the wall of force comes\n  down, but as soon as the PCs try to interfere, they fight back.

He sacrifices all three of the remaining cultists, which is enough to get the ritual started again, but\n    there’s simply not enough power. When the PCs attack, Meitremar panics and attempts to summon the vloriak. The vloriak\n    appears in its weakened state, but is not particularly happy about the situation. It shrieks in rage, then turns to\n    Meitremar and says, “Who are you to think yourself worthy of a dead demon’s notice? Nothing but a stain, mortal!” At\n    the same time, all four dead cultists rise as zombie shamblers. While the zombies move to attack the PCs, the vloriak\n    Spews Rusted Shards at Meitremar (in such a way that it doesn’t catch any PCs) and then attempts a claw Strike against\n    Meitremar.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If Meitremar’s turn takes place before the demon, he spends his turn first in an attempt to Demoralize the demon\n    (requiring a @Check[intimidation|dc:23|traits:auditory,concentrate,emotion,fear,mental,action:demoralize|name:Demoralize] check), and then activates the <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2sa06405advent.JournalEntryPage.05thehornofrus00]{Horn of Rust}</em>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If his turn takes place after the demon attacks him, Meitremar realizes his error and shrieks in terror—he becomes\n    frightened 1 and spends his first action to Stride as far from the demon as he can before activating the <em>Horn of Rust</em>.\n    All of this strains the magic enough that, at the end of the round, the vloriak is forced back to the Abyss, screaming\n    in frustration as it goes. The remainder of the combat consists of the PCs facing the zombies and the likely wounded\n    Meitremar, whose fury at their meddling compels him to fight to the death. This fight against Meitremar and four\n    zombies is a Moderate 3 encounter. If you wish to have an extra layer of drama, you can have Meitremar immediately\n    rise as a plague zombie capable of inflicting rust creep once he’s slain, as the lingering Abyssal energies infuse his\n    remains with sinister power.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<p>\n  <strong>Tactical Retreat:</strong> If the PCs realize they’re in over their heads in this fight and flee, the foes\n  they faced do not pursue them, but instead get back to the task of completing the ritual. If the vloriak demon is\n  still present, it returns to the Abyss soon after the PCs flee. The amount of time Meitremar needs to complete the\n  ritual is flexible, but at the very least you should give the PCs a day to head back into the upper works to disrupt\n  things a bit more before they try again. If you determine that the PCs have taken too long (perhaps after a third\n  failed attempt), see Concluding the Adventure below for the ramifications of Meitremar’s completed ritual.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.2c8g1noVjApqAtia]{Summoning Chamber}<br />\nIn addition to the gear carried by the cultists and Meitremar himself, the fate of the <em>Horn\n  of Rust</em> now falls to the PCs.
