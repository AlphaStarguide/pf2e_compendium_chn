This\n  was followed by the Shattered Star and Return of the Runelords Adventure Paths, and Pathfinder Second Edition most\n  recently continued the long-running story with Pathfinder Adventure Path #200: Seven Dooms for Sandpoint. Now, with\n  Revenge of the Runelords, the story of the runelords finally comes to a close, one that for the first time ever\n  requires the most powerful of all PCs: mythic heroes!\n</p>\n<p>\n  While Revenge of the Runelords will certainly have additional significance for groups who have played through the\n  previously mentioned Adventure Paths, it’s also a self-contained story, and for players who aren’t caught up on what\n  came before, make sure to check out the Recap of the Runelords section of this Player’s Guide,\n  where you can get up to speed on what the world of Golarion knows about these intolerant wizard rulers from the\n  ancient past.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You begin Revenge of the Runelords as 12th-level mythic characters. This Adventure Path is presented as a three-part\n  campaign that will bring your characters all the way to 20th level and the height of your characters’ mythic destinies\n  by the end. The campaign uses Pathfinder’s Remastered rules, so all you’ll need to play is Pathfinder Player Core (or\n  Pathfinder Player Core 2) and a character sheet. Since it’s for mythic characters, the rules presented in Pathfinder\n  War of Immortals are also invaluable. With your Game Master’s permission, you can also use other Pathfinder rulebooks,\n  campaign setting books, and accessories to further customize your character.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On the following pages, you’ll find specific suggestions to help you create a new character for Revenge of the\n  Runelords.

                            "text": "<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Ancestries</h2>\n<p>\n  Revenge of the Runelords begins in the Saga Lands, a region that has a diverse array of inhabitants already and that\n  has, for nearly two decades, been an irresistible draw to adventurers from across the world. As such, there’s very\n  little restriction on what sorts of ancestries you can choose to play from a societal viewpoint. From a thematic\n  viewpoint, some ancestries are relatively unknown in the region, but while PCs of these less common ancestries are\n  unlikely to find enclaves or settlements of people they might find familiar, the Saga Lands are accepting overall of\n  those from lands beyond their borders.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The following categories of common and uncommon ancestries are aimed at this thematic viewpoint, but any of the ones\n  mentioned here are equally appropriate choices for your Revenge of the Runelords character—just keep in mind that if\n  you pick an uncommon ancestry, chances are high that you won’t be encountering others of your ancestry during the\n  campaign!\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Common Ancestries</h3>\n<p>\n  The most populous ancestry in the Saga Lands are <strong>humans</strong>, particularly those of Shoanti, Taldan,\n  Ulfen, and Varisian descent, but you can expect to encounter humans of all ethnicities in the Saga Lands. Thassilonian\n  Azlanti are more present here than in many other places because Xin-Edasseril’s population was recently returned to\n  the modern timeline after being trapped in time for many years.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Other core ancestries are well represented in the Saga Lands as well, with each having notable regions they call home.\n  <strong>Dwarves</strong> often have families back home in the sky citadel of Janderhoff, while many of the region’s\n  elves know or are related to those who dwell in the Mierani Forest. <strong>Gnomes</strong> have strong presences in\n  the Linnorm Kingdoms and in the central forests of Varisia, while <strong>goblins</strong> are quite populous along\n  Varisia’s Lost Coast or the swampy reaches of the Mushfens. Many of the <strong>halflings</strong> who dwell in the\n  Saga Lands fled persecution from Cheliax, while orcs maintain a visible presence in the central and eastern\n  Cinderlands. The Saga Lands draw all manner of versatile heritages as well, particularly <strong>aiuvarins</strong>\n  and <strong>dromaars</strong>, but <strong>nephilim</strong> are relatively common as well.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Uncommon Ancestries</h3>\n<p>\n  While there are no major <strong>leshy</strong> settlements in the Saga Lands, druidic traditions are strong in the\n  region and as such they’re far from unknown. There are enclaves of <strong>iruxis</strong> in the Mushfens and clans\n  of <strong>kobolds</strong> throughout the region.\n  <strong>Hobgoblins</strong> are much less common than goblins, and what <strong>tengu</strong> dwell in the Saga Lands\n  tend to cluster in small and isolated groups in port cities. <strong>Fleshwarps</strong> are more widespread than many\n  realize, although they tend to assimilate into other cultures rather than forming their own neighborhoods. Other\n  ancestries than these are even less common in the Saga Lands, but there are very few that would be inappropriate for a\n  PC in this campaign.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Non-Recommended Ancestries</h3>\n<p>\n  While there are a few opportunities for aquatic ancestries to shine in this Adventure Path, the majority of the\n  encounters and story beats take place on land—if you want to play an aquatic ancestry, it’s best to ensure you won’t\n  be penalized by spending long periods out of the water.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While many portions of this Adventure Path take place in open areas, there are a fair number of smaller dungeon\n  confines that must be navigated. Large ancestries may potentially struggle with these parts of the campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Furthermore, though this Adventure Path doesn’t utilize undead as common foes, a general nervousness over and distrust\n  of undeath pervades through the Saga Lands. Consider the fact that many of those you’ll be working with as allies\n  might be nervous or distrustful of someone whose link to life is obviously missing.\n</p>\n<p>Speak with your GM if you’d like to play an aquatic or undead ancestry.</p>",

                            "text": "<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Classes</h2>\n<p>\n  Revenge of the Runelords offers a wide range of encounters—from classic dungeon crawls to roleplaying opportunities to\n  skill-based challenges, spread between urban, wilderness, underground, and even other-planar locations. All classes\n  can find places to shine during the course of play in this Adventure Path as a result, although some of them may find\n  their themes align more pleasingly with the region and story as it unfolds. Specific notes on class options are\n  presented below.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Alchemists</strong> can choose freely which research field they wish to pursue—there will be plenty of\n  opportunities for them to shine during the course of play. Goblin bombers are perhaps the most notorious of the Saga\n  Lands’ alchemists, with mutagenists who explore the ancient fleshwarping traditions of the runelords growing in\n  number.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Animists</strong> in the Saga Lands are often confused for oracles or sorcerers by those who don’t know any\n  better, something that some animists have used to their advantage. Animists who practice as liturgists or shamans are\n  the most widespread in the Saga Lands, but any animistic practice works well in this campaign. Apparitions associated\n  with Thassilonian legacies (such as Echoes of Lost Moments, Imposters in Hidden Places, Lurkers in the Devouring Dark,\n  Revelers in Lost Glee, and Witnesses to Ancient Battles) are the most thematically appropriate choices for this\n  campaign. See Spells on page 12 for suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Barbarians</strong> are most common in the northern and central regions of the Saga Lands. The instincts of\n  dragon, fury, and giant are strong thematic choices. The superstition instinct works well also, particularly if it’s\n  focused on magic you suspect to be tied to the ancient runelords or Thassilon in some way!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Bards</strong> have a strong traditional presence in the Saga Lands. The enigma muse is the best thematic fit\n  for this campaign’s story, while the maestro is more thematically appropriate for the general flavor of Saga Land\n  bards, but regardless of choice, all muses will work well in this campaign. See Skills and Feats on page 10 for\n  additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies, and Spells on page 12 for suggestions on thematic spell\n  selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Champions</strong> have long been regarded with awe by the people of the Saga Lands. See Faiths on page 9 for\n  additional guidance on religion or belief. The most thematically appropriate causes for a champion to pursue in this\n  campaign are grandeur, justice, liberation, and redemption.\n</p>\n<img src=\"modules/pf2e-ap219-221-revenge-of-the-runelords/assets/art/pzo15219-greedspawn-guardian.webp\" alt=\"Greedspawn Guardian\" data-tooltip=\"Greedspawn Guardian\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap219-221-revenge-of-the-runelords/assets/art/pzo15219-greedspawn-guardian.webp')\" class=\"float-right\" />\n<p>\n  <strong>Clerics</strong> should consider the additional information presented under Faiths (page 9) for guidelines for\n  which deity to worship. Also see Spells on page 12 for suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Commanders</strong> are no strangers to the Saga Lands, a region that has seen more than its fair share of\n  conflict over the eons. A burgeoning new clash between the eastern and western reaches of New Thassilon has been\n  brewing ever since the culmination of the events of Return of the Runelords, and while warfare has some background\n  themes in this Adventure Path, the PCs won’t be expected to command troops in battle. That said, there will be many\n  opportunities where the ability to influence and bolster other allies aside from just your fellow PCs can be of\n  significant aid.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Druids</strong> are well-known in the Saga Lands, and no druid order is a bad choice for this Adventure Path.\n  See the Pets and Companions section on page 11 for additional advice on your animal companion and Spells for\n  suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Exemplars</strong> are often drawn to the Saga Lands, but just as often are the product of the Saga Lands, for\n  this region of Avistan has legacies that predate Earthfall. While all root epithets are good choices for this\n  campaign, the Proud and the Radiant are particularly interesting in the way these epithets suggest ties to traditions\n  epitomized by certain runelords like Xanderghul or Sorshen. Regardless, as your story grows, consider building it in a\n  way that links you to the legacies of Thassilon in some way. Dominion epithets are all equally thematic for Revenge of\n  the Runelords, and while all the sovereignty epithets are also good choices, consider the Healer of the World in\n  particular, as “saving the world” is a key theme of what’s to come. When choosing your ikons, consider choosing them\n  in a way that bolsters your thematic links to your own mythic calling and destiny. See Skills and Feats on page 10 for\n  additional notes on where to focus your skill proficiencies and to help you choose your root epithet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Fighters</strong> are well represented in the Saga Lands. Work with your GM when choosing the type of weapon\n  your PC focuses on, as they might be able to guide your choices in a way that avoids spoilers for certain developments\n  in the storyline. There’ll still be plenty of fights to get into along the way, but you’ll want to consult Skills and\n  Feats on page 10 for additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies so you’ll have something to do when\n  there’s no fighting.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Guardians</strong> will find ample opportunities to stand against apparently insurmountable odds or protect\n  those less powerful from harrowing foes in this Adventure Path. Every battle will present a guardian with a chance to\n  shine.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Gunslingers</strong> are uncommon in the Saga Lands, but not unheard of. Since gunplay isn’t a key theme in\n  this Adventure Path, work with your GM so that this can be adjusted for your table’s game to help support a gunslinger\n  as a PC option.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Inventors</strong> in the Saga Lands are often drawn to the Thassilonian legacy of clockworks, yet all manner\n  of creative creations can find success here. No one inventor innovation is more appropriate than the other for Revenge\n  of the Runelords, but consider giving the flavor of your inventions a clockwork-type feel. See Skills and Feats on\n  page 10\n  for additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies, and keep in mind the advice for fighters above\n  regarding combat.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Investigators</strong> who focus on studying the ancient past will find their interests well rewarded in this\n  Adventure Path.\n  The most appropriate methodologies for an investigator in Revenge of the Runelords are those that focus on empiricism\n  or interrogation. See Skills and Feats on page 10 for additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Kineticists</strong> aren’t particularly widespread in the Saga Lands but should still find plenty of chances\n  to shine during combat and exploration in Revenge of the Runelords. No one element is a more thematically appropriate\n  choice than another in this campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Magi</strong> will find their abilities useful throughout this campaign but should consider the advice given\n  to fighters and wizards when making class choices. Thassilonian traditions that mix magic use with combat make the\n  magus a strong thematic choice, even though magi themselves weren’t particularly well-known in ancient Thassilon.\n  Hybrid studies that support combat with swords or polearms make inexorable iron the most thematically appropriate\n  choice. See Spells on page 12 for suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Monks</strong> are well-known in the Saga Lands. See Faiths on page 9 for additional guidance on religion or\n  belief, and Skills and Feats on page 10 for additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Oracles</strong> aren’t as common as clerics in the Saga Lands, but they’re still quite\n  well-known—particularly north of the Kodar Mountains. The most thematically appropriate mysteries for an oracle in\n  this Adventure Path are Ancestors,\n  Battle, and Lore. See Faiths on page 9 for additional guidance on religion or belief, and Spells on page 12 for\n  suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Psychics</strong> aren’t particularly common in the Saga Lands, and many mistake them for sorcerers. The\n  subconscious minds of gathered lore and wandering reverie are strong thematic choices, while the conscious mind of the\n  Infinite Eye is a good match for the investigation of ancient magical secrets, and both the Tangible Dream and the\n  Unbound Step work well with some of the more unusual themes awaiting discovery in the adventures ahead. In the end, no\n  one subconscious or conscious mind choice is a bad one for this campaign. See Spells on page 12 for suggestions on\n  thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Rangers</strong> are well known and respected in the Saga Lands. If you gain an animal companion, consult the\n  Pets and Companions suggestions on page 11 for advice. The Favored Terrain feat is an excellent choice for a ranger in\n  this Adventure Path, but keep in mind that there’s not a lot of terrain diversity in this story—arctic, mountain, sky,\n  and underground are perhaps the best options. Aquatic will have some play, while desert, forest, and swamp won’t have\n  much of a presence at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Rogues</strong> are quite common in the Saga Lands, be they criminals, folk heroes, or something in between.\n  The rogue rackets of mastermind and scoundrel fit most thematically here, but all rackets will be useful. See Skills\n  and Feats on page 10 for additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Sorcerers</strong> are among the most widespread and respected spellcasters in Varisia, with the practice of\n  sorcery predating the rise of Thassilon. To many, sorcerous magic is akin to a religious experience, regardless of the\n  type of magic a sorcerer might practice, with the tradition of tattoos representing one’s personal sorcerous history\n  and ancestry being widespread among the region’s Varisians. All sorcerer bloodlines are thematically appropriate for\n  this Adventure Path as a result. Consider some of the advice given in Faiths on page 9 for choosing some of your\n  sorcerous themes (particularly if you opt for a sorcerer who casts divine spells), and see Spells on page 12 for\n  suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Summoners</strong> aren’t well-known in the Saga Lands and are often mistaken for druids or other spellcasters\n  who have earned the loyalty of a supernatural follower. The exception is those who summon phantom eidolons, who have a\n  strong tradition among both the Varisians and Shoanti. The most thematically appropriate choices for eidolons in this\n  Adventure Path are anger phantom, construct (with clockwork themes), and devotion phantom, but no eidolon is\n  particularly off-theme.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Swashbucklers</strong> are, similar to fighters, relatively common and thematically appropriate for this\n  Adventure Path. More so than fighters, their skill in social situations will be an important asset. All swashbuckler\n  styles work well in Revenge of the Runelords, but the battledancer is perhaps the least thematic choice for the\n  challenges ahead simply because Performance isn’t one of the more important skills featured in this campaign. See\n  Skills and Feats on page 10\n  for additional advice on where to focus your skill proficiencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Thaumaturges</strong> are an excellent choice for this Adventure Path, particularly for those who seek the\n  power of ancient Thassilonian magics hidden in old monuments or strange treasures. All implements are equally\n  appropriate for a thaumaturge, although using an implement emblazoned with or incorporating themes from ancient\n  Thassilon (such as an amulet bearing the Sihedron symbol, a polearm akin to those once wielded by the runelords, or\n  regalia in the style of that ancient empire) will certainly fit well!\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Witches</strong> are both well-known and feared in the northern reaches of the Saga Lands, particularly in\n  Irrisen. While this Adventure Path doesn’t spend time in that region, a traveling winter witch could be a fun addition\n  to the party.\n  Elsewhere in the Saga Lands, witches are culturally important spellcasters, although not quite as much as sorcerers.\n  Witches whose patrons are tied to a religion can look to the section on Faiths on page 9 for additional inspiration.\n  Alternatively, your patron could be tied to some of the ancient regional traditions or to Thassilon’s legacy, in which\n  case the patrons of the Inscribed One or the Resentment are good choices. Speak with your GM when choosing your patron\n  for additional guidance. See Spells on page 12 for suggestions on thematic spell selection and Pets and Companions on\n  page 11 for some advice on thematic familiar selection.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Wizards</strong> in the Saga Lands have ties to the region’s ancient legacy of rune magic practiced and\n  developed by Thassilon’s runelords, and while the thousands of years since Thassilon’s fall have removed much of the\n  stigma associated with these cruel overlords, the recent resurgence of runelord activity and the rise of New Thassilon\n  have both bolstered interest and rekindled old fears in the practice of wizardly magic. Given the historical role\n  wizardry plays in the Saga Lands, all arcane theses are thematically appropriate choices in this Adventure Path, as\n  are all arcane schools. In particular, consider pursuing the runelord archetype from Pathfinder Lost Omens Rival\n  Academies—this tradition of spellcasting developed from the ancient traditions of Thassilon, after all! See Archetypes\n  on page 12 for more advice if you decide to take this option as well as the Spells section on the same page for\n  suggestions on thematic spell selection.\n</p>"

Beyond these deities, others who are commonly worshipped in Varisia\n  (where most of this Adventure Path takes place) include Ashava, Black Butterfly, Kazutal, Milani, Shizuru, Tsukiyo,\n  and Ylimancha. In addition, Nocticula’s faith plays a larger role in this Adventure Path, so an adherent of her faith\n  will find much to explore—if you wish to play a worshipper of Nocticula, speak with your GM about potentially reading\n  the article about Nocticula that appears in the first volume of the Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While evil deities could be patrons of PCs in this Adventure Path, keep in mind that those whose edicts and anathemas\n  might put you at odds with the goal of working with the other PCs, wanting to save the world, or seeking to aid large\n  numbers of people in need make for poor choices in this campaign. If you’re interested in worshipping an unholy deity,\n  speak to your GM and fellow players about it first to determine if your concept for a PC will fit with the group and\n  the Adventure Path’s expectations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Deities and faiths associated with the end of the world or mass destruction are poor thematic choices all around,\n  whether they’re actively evil in nature (such as Rovagug) or more nihilistic (such as Groetus). Revenge of the\n  Runelords expects the PCs to be eager to save the world, not eager to see it destroyed, and a faith that pushes you\n  toward the end of all things is a character option best set aside for a different campaign.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Hero Gods</h3>\n<p>\n  If you’re bringing in a character from the Myth-Speaker Adventure Path, any of the faiths from Iblydos or those\n  mentioned in the Myth-Speaker Player’s Guide are fine choices for this Adventure Path as well. Keep in mind, however,\n  that the themes that carry forward from that Adventure Path are relatively limited to the basic concept of playing a\n  mythic character; don’t focus overmuch on the real-world mythological inspirations and themes for Myth-Speaker, on the\n  city-state politics of Iblydos, or on the machinations of that campaign’s villains. See the section on the\n  Myth-Speaker Adventure Path in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2reven00rorpgh.JournalEntryPage.00whatcamebefo00]{What Came\n  Before?} for more advice.\n</p>"

It’s also attracted Queen Sorshen’s attention, and in her invitation to attend the\n    opening ceremonies for the Circle of Open Hands, she made it clear she wants to engage you in several long\n    discussions\n    about the truths of ancient Thassilon, impressing upon you that while the runelords (including herself, she admits)\n    of\n    the ancient era were cruel and domineering, that many of the wonders they created could benefit the modern age–if\n    people could trust that these wonders were safe!

What\n  did they do during their first 11 levels? How did they gain their mythic calling? What sort of history do they bring\n  to the table? Work with the GM and other players to come up with these details—especially if the group wants a shared\n  history of previous adventures together!\n</p>\n<p>\n  But what if you and your fellow players have already played an entire campaign and have built up characters from lower\n  level to 12th level?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since Revenge of the Runelords starts at 12th level—the point at which a PCs’ mythic destiny kicks in, most of Paizo’s\n  Adventure Paths won’t quite fit perfectly, since lower-level Adventure Paths that start at 1st level generally only go\n  to 10th level. In cases like this, work with your GM. They might want to create a custom adventure for you and the\n  other players to go on to account for your 11th level—one that could be focused on transitioning from your previous\n  campaign into Revenge of the Runelords. Alternatively, at the start of Revenge of the Runelords’ first adventure, an\n  option exists for GMs to adjust an early complex encounter to “stand in” for your 11th level—your GM will work with\n  you in this case to get your PCs ready (and in this case, you’ll start Revenge of the Runelords as 11th-level\n  characters).\n</p>\n<p>\n  In most cases, you won’t have played a previous Adventure Path as mythic characters. In this case, your mythic calling\n  should be something that manifests in your PC as a result of those previous adventures. Take time before you begin\n  Revenge of the Runelords to choose a mythic calling for your PC and apply all those choices at once, rather than going\n  through them one level at a time during play. This gives your PC a sudden boost in power in the form of 5 bonus feats\n  (one gained at every even-numbered level from 2nd up to 10th), so make sure you take time to familiarize yourself with\n  the effects of your mythic calling and the five bonus mythic feats you choose!\n</p>\n<p>\n  That said, two of Paizo’s Adventure Paths make for particularly strong lead-ins to a Revenge of the Runelords\n  Adventure Path.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Seven Dooms for Sandpoint</h2>\n<p>\n  Seven Dooms for Sandpoint doesn’t focus much on the runelords. Its story is relatively self-contained, and though\n  Sandpoint itself doesn’t feature in Revenge of the Runelords, this Adventure Path remains, thematically and\n  level-wise, the most appropriate lead-in. After completing Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, your PCs will be 12th level, and\n  you’ll have immersed yourself in a fair amount of the ancient mysteries, lore, and themes of Varisia. Your Saga Lands\n  reputation as a hero spreads quickly from Sandpoint to Magnimar, Riddleport, and Korvosa, but more importantly, to\n  Xin-Eurythnia. Queen Sorshen has agents throughout the Saga Lands, and word of your bravery in saving Sandpoint from\n  several supernatural threats caught her eye—not only from the angle of your triumphs as local heroes (whose fame and\n  passion make for excellent potential ambassadors to the world at large, something Sorshen knows she needs to convince\n  potential trade partners that she has indeed put her old runelord ways behind her), but because of the unexpected\n  discoveries your group made in the Pit not far from Sandpoint. In her invitation to your group to attend the opening\n  ceremonies for the Circle of Open Hands, she even floats the idea of creating a trade portal to Sandpoint (or if not\n  there, to nearby Magnimar)—an offer that could potentially catapult the town into a more productive future than the\n  peril-based mayhem it’s become known for since the Late Unpleasantness, when the dooms that faced Sandpoint truly\n  picked up momentum. She also makes it clear that she’s very interested in hearing all about your adventures in the\n  Pit, particularly anything that you might have learned or discovered about the place’s original architects.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While your PCs are the right level to begin Revenge of the Runelords fresh out of Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, that\n  Adventure Path wasn’t meant to be a mythic Adventure Path. While a GM could certainly adjust Seven Dooms for Sandpoint\n  to allow for the PCs to explore their mythic callings, a better option would be for your PCs to gain their mythic\n  callings immediately upon completing the previous Adventure Path, as a final reward for saving the town from its seven\n  dooms. As detailed above, selecting your PCs’ mythic calling and 5 associated mythic feats is an easier route to\n  take—especially if you think of these as boons granted from fate, a deity, or even exposure to certain potent magical\n  sources of power deep in the Pit.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The journey to Xin-Eurythnia is not presented in Revenge of the Runelords. The first adventure begins with the PCs\n  already in town, having recently arrived (and potentially pursuing some downtime activities detailed at the end of\n  this Player’s Guide), so if your group is short on XP, your GM might decide to turn the 1,200-mile journey from\n  Sandpoint to Xin-Eurythnia into a short adventure for you to reach 12th level. Even if you’re already 12th level,\n  having one or two short combat encounters along this trip for you and the other PCs to try out their new mythic feats\n  and mythic calling isn’t a bad idea—speak to your GM about whether this option works best, or if you and the other\n  players would prefer to just hit the ground running in Xin-Eurythnia, having already made the long journey across\n  Varisia. Regardless, one of the first things you’ll do as the new campaign begins is gain your mythic destinies, so as\n  detailed above, feel free to pre-select those choices so you can get into the new adventure without a hitch!\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Myth-Speaker</h2>\n<p>\n  While Seven Dooms for Sandpoint might be the most thematically and level-appropriate precursor to a Revenge of the\n  Runelords game, Myth-Speaker is the best option if you want to experience the full growth of mythic callings and feats\n  from 1st level. While this Adventure Path takes place thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent, and\n  its story and themes are quite different than those of Revenge of the Runelords, the mythic powers your PCs gain\n  present perhaps the best reason for Queen Sorshen to take note of your accomplishments. As a mythic spellcaster\n  herself, Sorshen has worked to keep abreast of the development of new mythic power in the world—in part as a defensive\n  ploy (after all, her longest-running feud has been with a fellow mythic spellcaster, Runelord Xanderghul), but also\n  because she’s eager to potentially ally with other mythic heroes. Her invitation to your group to join her a continent\n  away in the city of Xin-Eurythnia includes congratulations and admiration for what you’ve accomplished in Iblydos,\n  something that might normally feel unsettling (considering she is a powerful wizard from a land far away), but she\n  makes it clear in the invitation that your group has sent ripples through the world’s magical leylines, and destiny\n  itself has taken note. Legendary myths like you are just the allies she wants at her side to help usher New Thassilon\n  into the modern era by linking her capital city with a network of portals. The linking of one to Iblydos is certainly\n  something she’s eager to pursue, yet not without the advice and input from that land’s newest mythic heroes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As with the link to Seven Dooms for Sandpoint, the method by which you and the other PCs travel from Iblydos to\n  eastern New Thassilon’s Xin-Eurythnia is left to you and your GM to explore, but even more so than above, building a\n  custom adventure to account for how your party transitions from Iblydos to New Thassilon (including not only the\n  journey but the potentially complex act of making sure that your interests in your homeland remain safe and secure) to\n  allow you to go from 11th level to 12th level is a good idea. Your GM can use this chance to bridge thematic gaps\n  between the two campaigns or simply use it to wrap things up and get you ready for something brand new. There’s also\n  some early suggestions in the first adventure for Revenge of the Runelords on how to expand an early encounter there\n  into an entire level’s worth of content. Likewise, the “Continuing the Campaign” advice in the final Myth-Speaker\n  adventure provides your GM with ample plot hooks and stories that could be explored, including some more GM-facing\n  advice for how to follow that Adventure Path up with this one.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Work with your GM on how best to solve this situation, but if you, them, and the other players are eager to jump into\n  Revenge of the Runelords and your mythic destinies, then simply leveling up to 12th level is a perfectly fine\n  solution!\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Hero-Gods of Iblydos</h3>\n<p>\n  Your PC from Myth-Speaker may wish to continue their path as one of the hero-gods of Iblydos. If you wish to do so,\n  work with your GM—they have additional options to potentially share with you when it comes to mythic feat choices for\n  your mythic destiny, which is traditionally the godling mythic destiny, as detailed on pages 130–133 of War of\n  Immortals. With your GM’s consent, though, you could potentially pursue your role as a hero-god of Iblydos by taking\n  the heroic scion mythic destiny, interpreting this not as your PC being a reincarnated previous PC, but instead\n  becoming infused with mythic power as a result of your strong ties to the land of your birth.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a hero-god, you might wish to work with NPCs and other agents of your cult to ensure that, while you’re away on\n  this new adventure, things back in Iblydos don’t develop in undesired ways. The physical distance between Iblydos and\n  the Saga Lands will also be a factor, as not being in Iblydos tends to weaken a hero-god’s spell-granting abilities.\n  Perhaps part of the trip through 11th level involves a short quest by the party to create some sort of artifact that\n  can help to link your power to that of your worshippers as you travel, or maybe some of your worshippers travel with\n  you to Xin-Eurythnia to potentially set up shrines in this distant land—although this option will require much more\n  work from your GM to adjust the storyline of Revenge of the Runelords! Perhaps the simplest solution is to set up a\n  schedule by which you periodically return to Iblydos to bolster your worshippers. In this case, work with your GM to\n  set up methods by which your PC can communicate with or even travel to and from that land when they get a chance\n  during Revenge of the Runelords—they may even find a way to link some of the previous campaign’s plot developments and\n  unresolved mysteries into the new campaign!\n</p>"

A PC who’s out of Mythic Points or is starved for them\n    won’t feel mythic to play, and GMs should keep a close watch on the amount of Mythic Points they award during play.\n    The Revenge of the Runelords encounters are generous in their reminders and suggestions as to when to give out\n    Mythic Points, but one method of regaining Mythic Points that can’t be anticipated or accounted for in a published\n    adventure is when a PC follows their mythic calling. Whenever your PC does something that you feel qualifies as\n    following their calling, it’s fine to ask the GM if that action or activity was something that might award your PC a\n    Mythic Point (although it might be a good idea to wait for an encounter to end before making this request). If\n    you’re the GM, handing out Mythic Point rewards frequently during play is a great way to encourage your players to\n    keep leaning into their mythic powers and potential. It’s not a very mythic campaign, after all, if your players\n    never get to actually spend Mythic Points to accomplish incredible feats!\n  </p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>\n  The Revenge of the Runelords Adventure Path takes the PCs from levels 12 through 20, corresponding to the levels when\n  mythic destinies come into play. The point at which your PCs actually gain their first mythic destiny dedication feat\n  occurs nearly at the start of the first adventure—when you prepare for this campaign, you can choose with mythic\n  destiny is best for your PC ahead of time, but keep in mind that when the campaign begins, you won’t immediately have\n  access to that feat’s power or that destiny’s flavor. These things will come later!\n</p>\n<p>\n  Mythic rules grant the PCs additional resilience and a handful of additional feats, similar in many ways to gaining a\n  free archetype. The following is a brief primer on mythic gameplay.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Mythic Points and Proficiency:</strong> A mythic character starts each game session with 3 Mythic\n    Points, which can be expended to use various mythic powers. Doing extraordinary deeds and overcoming mythic\n    challenges can restore one or more points, so you’ll have numerous opportunities to feel mythic during each game\n    session. Many mythic abilities let a PC attempt a check with mythic proficiency, which is a level of proficiency\n    beyond legendary; this lets the PC perform tasks requiring even legendary proficiency, and their proficiency\n    modifier is +10! Of course, for high-level PCs like those who you’ll be playing in this campaign, there’s less of an\n    impact, since the jump between trained and mythic proficiency is much larger than between legendary and mythic. The\n    additional powers you’ll gain from your mythic destiny, however, will leave you with no shortage of options to spend\n    those points on during play. Alternatively, you might consider picking up mythic feats that allow you to\n    periodically attempt checks at mythic proficiency in skills you haven’t already spent the resources improving\n    through the normal course of leveling up your PC. See the section on\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2reven00rorpgh.JournalEntryPage.00skillsandfea00]{Skills} for a\n    breakdown of which skill choices might be best for this campaign.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Mythic Calling:</strong> A PC’s calling is their first step toward mythic power, similar to how a\n    background is a character’s first step toward their adventuring life. A calling provides a PC with their first way\n    to spend Mythic Points, as well as with a unique way to regain a Mythic Point once per day. For example, the\n    Demagogue’s Calling lets a PC spend a Mythic Point to Coerce or Make an Impression using mythic proficiency, and\n    critically succeeding at a check to Coerce, Make an Impression, or Create a Distraction can restore an expended\n    Mythic Point. Four new @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2reven00rorpgh.JournalEntryPage.00mythiccallin00]{Mythic Callings} are\n    presented in this Player’s Guide for you to consider if you’re building a\n    new PC or converting an existing PC for play in this campaign.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Mythic Feats:</strong> At every even level, a mythic PC gains a mythic feat chosen from a list\n    available to all PCs. Mythic feats typically introduce new ways to spend Mythic Points to perform exceptional deeds.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <strong>Mythic Destiny:</strong> At 12th level, when this campaign begins, each PC chooses a mythic\n    destiny, which is like a high-level archetype that shapes the PC’s personal transformation or apotheosis—it allows\n    them to become anything from a celestial to a demigod to an immortal ruler of legend. Pathfinder War of Immortals\n    presents nine mythic destinies for you to choose from, and the first volume of Revenge of the Runelords expands\n    these options with four additional mythic destinies designed to mesh well with this campaign’s themes. Speak with\n    your GM to find out more about these four additional options before you make your final decision as to which mythic\n    destiny is right for your PC!\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  In summary, mythic gameplay adds a little complexity and expands what your character can do, yet these options are\n  introduced gradually and function much like the Pathfinder game you already know and enjoy.\n</p>"

There’s not a lot of built-in downtime where\n  PCs will be able to use skills like Crafting, Lore, and Performance to craft things or Earn Income (although there are\n  other ways these skills can be useful—see below). Any skill that your character relies on as an alternative to\n  Perception for Initiative (Deception and Stealth being two prime examples) will always be a good investment for those\n  types of PCs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Research: </strong>Whether its simply attempting a check to Recall Knowledge, going deeper into a research\n  challenge, or handling any number of other skill-based challenges, Arcana, Occultism, and Religion will be used quite\n  often.

See the special section on @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2reven00rorpgh.JournalEntryPage.00skillsandfea00]{Lore Skills}.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Physical Challenges:</strong> Whether navigating perilous wilderness hazards, dealing with unexpected\n  barriers, handling traps, or facing other physical challenges resolved outside of combat, PCs will use Athletics quite\n  often to resolve situations. To a lesser extent, Thievery will be quite useful, particularly in handling traps and\n  similar hazards, and to an even lesser extent, Crafting can help with jury-rigged solutions or maker-based resolutions\n  to problems. Acrobatics, Medicine, and Stealth will rarely be used in these manners—their value in your build\n  primarily resides in the evergreen Skills category.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Social Challenges:</strong> Revenge of the Runelords isn’t all about fighting, enduring overwhelming physical\n  challenges, or researching ancient mysteries. You will often be faced with NPCs who you must interact with in social\n  challenges, be they simple attempts to adjust attitudes or more complex influence encounters. Diplomacy is the most\n  useful skill for these challenges, followed by Intimidation and then Deception. Opportunities to use Performance to\n  solve social challenges exist as well, but much less frequently than the three skills mentioned above.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Survival:</strong> This skill isn’t used often in Revenge of the Runelords, but there are a few instances\n  where being able to Track will be helpful. Of all the non-Lore skills, Survival has the fewest additional\n  opportunities beyond its evergreen uses to shine—but having one PC in the group who’s good at this skill could be an\n  unexpected boon at a few rare points in the campaign.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Lore Skills:</strong> Beyond being used to Recall Knowledge on creatures or other topics, Lore skills come\n  into play relatively frequently when exploring or researching mysteries or influencing NPCs. In such cases, these\n  checks often represent the easiest DCs to hit, reflecting the nature of this skill’s specialization. In a rare few\n  cases, challenges will allow a PC to use any Lore skill for this purpose, but otherwise, the most commonly utilized\n  Lore skills in Revenge of the Runelords are (in descending order of frequency) Warfare, Academia, Library, and Art.\n  Beyond this, Architecture, Mercantile, and Mountain Lore checks have a few specific callouts. The following Lores each\n  have one specific point during the campaign where they have a specific use: Astronomy, Clockwork, Dimension of Time,\n  Dragon, Engineering, Labor, Legal, Nocticula, Ocean, and Underworld. Unmentioned Lore skills aren’t as useful, but as\n  always when you’re picking a Lore skill for your PC, speak to your GM—a good GM is always eager and willing to include\n  opportunities for “off-kilter” or unexpected Lore choices, or at the very least should be able to advise you on\n  thematically better choices that have a similar flavor to what you have in mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Feats:</strong> When choosing feats—particularly skill feats—consider the above general advice for skills (or\n  in the case of the Pet feat, the advice below for Pets and Companions). Feats that have evergreen uses in combat (such\n  as Fleet, Scare to Death, or Toughness) are always good choices, while those who link to specific downtime activities\n  (such as Crafting or Earning Income) aren’t going to be as well-used during this campaign. Since there are relatively\n  few language barriers in this Adventure Path, Multilingual isn’t a great choice—unless you’re using it to pick up\n  Thassilonian, in which case it’s a solid pick. Any feat that bolsters your skill at Identifying Magic will be helpful,\n  as there are a lot of ancient magical curiosities and dangers to explore in this Adventure Path. Don’t be afraid to\n  chat with your GM about a feat choice, especially one where its opportunities for use depends less on what you can\n  control as a PC and more on the course of the adventure itself.\n</p>"

In-world, some of these discoveries and revelations have made their\n  way into popular culture, particularly in the Saga Lands, where this Adventure Path is largely set. While the people\n  of the Saga Lands (including your PCs) know a fair amount of baseline knowledge about runelords and Thassilon, that\n  may not be the case for players who might be new to the story or the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The following presents common knowledge about these topics in the Saga Lands. There’ll be ample opportunities during\n  play for your PCs to learn and remember more (if only via Recalling Knowledge), but this information includes all of\n  what your PC would likely know already. Note that there are some spoilers in the following about the plots for the\n  previous three Adventure Paths that focused on this continuing story, but they’re kept as vague as possible while\n  still providing the context your PCs need in this new Adventure Path.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>What is a Runelord?</h2>\n<p>\n  The term “runelord” has three different connotations in modern-day Golarion, but it’s the first that has the most\n  bearing on this Adventure Path. In this connotation, a “runelord” was a ruler of one of the seven nations of ancient\n  Thassilon, which predated Earthfall. Each runelord was a powerful wizard whose magic was focused on a particular kind\n  of magic associated with one of the seven sins—pride (with a focus on illusion magic), lust (with a focus on mental\n  magic), gluttony (with a focus on magic associated with life, death, and undeath), greed (magic focused on physical\n  transformations), wrath (magic focused on destruction and elemental power), envy (magic focused on defenses and the\n  disruption of other magical effects), and sloth (magic focused on conjuring and summoning creatures and objects). All\n  these runelords were evil and cruel, but there were only really ever 7 of them active at a time—the title “runelord”\n  in this context is more akin to “king” or “queen.” They lived lifetimes, and traditionally only stepped down from\n  ruling of their nation when they were supplanted—usually via treachery and violence—by a successor.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In modern Golarion, after the magical traditions of the runelords had been rediscovered and an entire population of\n  ancient Thassilonians escaped from being trapped in time to help found New Thassilon, the word “runelord” has taken on\n  a new meaning. A new group of arcane spellcasters adopted the now unfashionable title of “runelord” for themselves.\n  Rather than seek to rule over nations, these new runelords developed methods of using magic and wielding weapons\n  inspired from those long-gone rulers. There’s no limit to the number of these “new runelords” that can exist at a\n  time, and they can be of any power level. There are already factions of runelords forming, with their most vocal\n  faction increasingly counting themselves as the heirs to Thassilon’s legacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The practices of these newer runelords are available as player character options via the runelord class archetype,\n  presented on pages 114–119 of Lost Omens Rival Academies. It’s important to remember that these runelords—be they NPCs\n  or PCs—are not the same as those whose legacies of cruelty forged Thassilon or whose plots for revenge are about to\n  come to fruition!\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>What is a Runewell?</h2>\n<p>\n  The runelords of Thassilon created an amazing number of powerful magic items, such as the legendary seven swords of\n  sin, or the unique magic polearms they carried as badges of office. But the most notorious of their creations were\n  their runewells—artifacts that only a few runelords ever managed to craft. A runewell is a focus of power, and each\n  lies inside of a personal demiplane (known as an “Eye”) that serves as a sort of “panic room” and hidden\n  stronghold/laboratory/treasury for a runelord. Each runewell extends a portal into Golarion, linking via an artifact\n  known as an anima focus that allows runelords and those who know the way to come and go from its Eye. Each runewell\n  has other specific and unique powers that vary from runelord to runelord. The only runelords who ever created a\n  runewell were Sorshen, Xanderghul, Alaznist, Karzoug, and Belimarius (but Belimarius’s runewell is faulty). (The other\n  two final runelords, Zutha and Krune, used other methods to avoid Earthfall and achieve immortality or life after\n  death.)\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Who Were the Runelords?</h2>\n<img src=\"modules/pf2e-ap219-221-revenge-of-the-runelords/assets/art/pzo15221-belimarius.webp\" alt=\"Runelord of Envy Belimarius\" data-tooltip=\"Runelord of Envy Belimarius\" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap219-221-revenge-of-the-runelords/assets/art/pzo15221-belimarius.webp')\" class=\"float-right\" />\n<p>\n  Thassilon existed for over a thousand years, and during that time, dozens of different powerful wizards rose to the\n  title of runelord, only to be supplanted by an apprentice, competitor, or betrayer. In the end, when Earthfall struck\n  and destroyed Thassilon, only seven runelords were in control of the seven nations of the land, and it was these\n  seven, the final runelords of Thassilon, who have had the most impact on the modern world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Xanderghul, the Runelord of Pride, was the most powerful of the runelords, and one of only two runelords who was never\n  replaced during Thassilon’s existence. His magic focused on illusions and avoided magic that conjured effects or\n  created physical transformations, and his polearm of choice was the bec de corbin. He ruled the realm of Cyrusian,\n  which occupied much of northern Varisia and the southern Lands of the Linnorm Kingdoms. He was assassinated in his\n  runewell’s demiplane by Runelord Alaznist in the events leading up to Return of the Runelords.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Sorshen, the Runelord of Lust, was almost as powerful as Xanderghul, and was the second runelord who was never\n  replaced. Her magic focused on mind control and mental manipulation and avoided magic associated with transforming\n  physicality or the manipulation of life, death, and undeath. Her polearm of choice was the guisarme. She ruled the\n  realm of Eurythnia, which occupied much of southern Varisia (much of which sunk into the sea or transformed into the\n  Mushfens after Earthfall). She woke from her runewell’s demiplane during the events of Return of the Runelords and is\n  one of the seven final runelords to survive to the modern era, where she now rules eastern New Thassilon as its queen,\n  having abandoned the title of runelord to the past.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Alaznist, the Runelord of Wrath, focused her magic on destruction and the harnessing of elemental forces, while\n  avoiding defensive magic and magic that conjured objects and effects. Her favored polearm was the ranseur, and she\n  ruled the realm of Bakrakhan in what is now western Varisia. This part of Thassilon was the worst struck by Earthfall,\n  and much of Bakrakhan sunk below the waves and is now deep under the Varisian Gulf. Runelord Alaznist triggered the\n  devastating events of Return of the Runelords and was defeated by a group of heroes before she could succeed at her\n  plans.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Karzoug, the Runelord of Greed, is perhaps the most notorious of the seven final runelords, for he was first to rise\n  from slumber several thousand years after Earthfall sent the runelords into stasis. His magic focused on\n  transformative effects and avoided magic that crafted illusions or manipulated the mind; his favored polearm was the\n  glaive. His nation of Shalast was located in much of central Varisia, lands that largely survived Earthfall to this\n  day. He was defeated by heroes during the events of Rise of the Runelords.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Zutha, the Runelord of Gluttony, was one of the rare undead runelords—a powerful lich who bound his magic to a\n  tripartite spellbook called the Gluttonous Tome instead of to a runewell. His magic focused on effects associated with\n  void and undeath and turned away from defensive magic and magic that affected the mind. He favored the scythe as his\n  polearm, and ruled the nation of Gastash, which occupied eastern Varisia and a significant portion of western Belkzen.\n  The destruction of the Gluttonous Tome during the events of Return of the Runelords prevented him from returning to\n  undeath.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Belimarius, the Runelord of Envy, is the other runelord who survived the events of Return of the Runelords. Her magic\n  focused on defensive effects and magic that could unravel and dispel other magical effects. Her polearm of choice was\n  the halberd, and she ruled the land of Edasseril—a nation whose name the first runelord of envy stole from the elves\n  who lived south of their lands in the Mierani Forest. Edasseril occupied a portion of the Ironbound Archipelago and\n  some of northwestern Varisia and today exists as the western half of New Thassilon, where Runelord Belimarius\n  continues to command. Unlike Sorshen, Belimarius has not only retained her old methods and beliefs from pre-Earthfall\n  Thassilon but also sees herself as the sole remaining runelord worthy of carrying Thassilon’s legacy into the future.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Krune, the Runelord of Sloth, was the least powerful of the final runelords. His magic focused on the conjuration of\n  creatures, objects, and effects, and turned away from magic associated with destruction or illusions. His polearm of\n  choice was the longspear. Alone of the final seven runelords, Krune didn’t actually survive Earthfall, but he was\n  momentarily resurrected in the years after the events of Rise of the Runelords, only to be defeated and then laid to\n  rest during the events of Return of the Runelords.\n</p>"

                            "text": "<h1 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Exploring Xin-Eurythnia</h1>\n<p>\n  For thousands of years, the remote ruins of Xin-Shalast, once the capital city of Runelord Karzoug’s nation, lay\n  hidden and mostly forgotten in the inhospitable heights of the eastern Kodar Mountains. Karzoug chose this place as\n  his capital for its remoteness, so the mountains themselves could offer protection from his enemies (among whom he\n  counted other runelords, particularly Alaznist), but also because layers of reality here between Golarion and the\n  world of dreams were thin—his alliances with nightmares from Leng helped to secure his position of power over the\n  final centuries of Thassilon’s rule.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After his rise and defeat, Xin-Shalast’s rediscovery by modern adventurers led to a rush of exploration from those\n  eager to claim the ancient powers within the ruined city, but it wasn’t until Sorshen awoke and relocated here to make\n  the city her own after the events of Return of the Runelords that Xin-Shalast began to once more thrive. Sorshen\n  rebuilt the protections and magical wardings that kept the high-altitude city comfortable and safe, and in the\n  following years, she continued to build the city into something she hoped would become a destination for travelers,\n  traders, and artisans from across the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yet despite her power, the city’s remoteness kept Xin-Shalast from recovering as quickly as she hoped. To the west,\n  Runelord Belimarius was achieving much greater success in revitalizing her section of New Thassilon, but her stubborn\n  clinging to the old ways was damaging to New Thassilon’s viability as a productive nation in the modern world. Sorshen\n  knew it would be but a matter of time before Belimarius’s warmongering and cruelty would bring about her doom, even as\n  she did her best to temper Belimarius’s actions in hopes that, some day, she might have a similar epiphany as did\n  Sorshen.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Today, Sorshen has admitted to herself that Belimarius is unlikely to ever achieve such a change of heart, and so\n  she’s taken steps to “rebrand” Karzoug’s old city. First among these changes has been to rename the city to\n  Xin-Eurythnia, after her old capital (now largely in ruins or buried deep under the modern, thriving city of Korvosa).\n  She’s recruited a wide range of powerful spellcasters and creatures to aid in the rebuilding of the city, and with the\n  aid of the church of Nocticula, has largely positioned Xin-Eurythnia as a place that welcomes all exiles and creators\n  from oppressed lands—not just those that share a border with New Thassilon.\n</p>\n<p>\n  But through it all, the city’s remoteness remains a struggle. And thus comes Sorshen’s latest gambit—the creation of a\n  portal hub she calls the Circle of Open Hands. When it’s activated, a stable portal will manifest between\n  Xin-Eurythnia and the City at the Center of the World—Absalom. After that, she can extend her portal to other places\n  around the world, in hopes of turning Xin-Eurythnia into a hub for trade and travel. There’s still much to be done\n  before such visions can become reality, not the least of which is to secure the cooperation of other distant locations\n  like Goka, the Magaambya, and other key places across the world, but for now, the activation of a magical portal\n  between Xin-Eurythnia and Absalom is first.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Many of her allies are already in Absalom, ready to receive the portal’s magical link, but it’s in her city of\n  Xin-Eurythnia that Sorshen intends to lead the opening ceremonies. To this event, she’s invited heroes from across the\n  world to take part, hoping that they can see her earnestness and bring back to their homelands word that the old\n  Runelord Sorshen is no more, and that Xin-Eurythnia can be a revolutionary trade partner in the future. Heroes, she’s\n  come to realize, are among the world’s true movers and shakers, for they step in to accomplish what the rulers of\n  nations cannot—and by some definitions, things even the gods themselves hesitate to do.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Welcome to Xin-Eurythnia</h2>\n<p>\n  Since your PCs are expected to be newcomers to the city, not locals, an actual gazetteer or list of notable locals to\n  interact with in Xin-Eurythnia is not presented here—these are things you will be able to do during the course of play\n  once things begin. While you won’t be spending the entirety of Revenge of the Runelords in Xin-Eurythnia, at the start\n  of the campaign, it’s going to be a place where you can shop, explore, and more! The following brief entries help to\n  define the city’s districts.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Artisan District is the city’s southernmost neighborhood. Here, the city’s artists and crafters maintain their\n  shops, and it’s here that the majority of the resources and opportunities for visitors can be found—inns, eateries,\n  and shops. This is the closest thing Xin-Eurythnia has to a “market district,” although shops and smaller marketplaces\n  can still be found throughout the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Residential District runs up along the city’s eastern side—once a place where the least fortunate of the city’s\n  citizens were forced to live as prisoners, and then largely destroyed by volcanism triggered by Earthfall, today\n  efforts to restore the district has resulted in a highly-livable area where the majority of the newcomers from other\n  lands have chosen to settle.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Jotunburg occupies the heart of the city, and here the buildings loom larger than life for a very good reason, for\n  this is where the city’s giants dwell. In Karzoug’s time, the giants of Jotunburg were soldiers and architects who\n  treated the humans to the south with contempt and violence. Today, the buildings are occupied by a small fraction of\n  the giants who once dwelt here, but these giants—along with many other “monstrous” inhabitants like lamias—live in\n  relative peace with their smaller neighbors. The breathtaking towers and domes of what was once the pride of Shalast’s\n  military, Shahlaria, sit on the western side of Jotunburg, and now serve Queen Sorshen as her Blood Moon Palace.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Entertainment District occupies the northern section of Xin-Eurythnia, yet this name is something of a misnomer.\n  While vast museums, arenas, galleries, racetracks, playhouses and more can be found here, so to can sprawling temples,\n  schools, and immense buildings occupied by some of the most powerful of Xin-Eurythnia’s new residents. It’s at the\n  heart of this district, in the so-called Temple Plaza, itself overlooked by the city’s recently sanctified cathedral\n  of Nocticula (known as Midnight’s Gallery), that Sorshen intends to unveil the Circle of Open Hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The Rising District once housed Runelord Karzoug’s most loyal nobles, his apprentices, and those whom he wanted to\n  keep the closest eye on. This district wound up into the heights of Mhar Massif, Avistan’s tallest peak, where near\n  said peak rose Karzoug’s own fortress: the Pinnacles of Avarice. Looming over it all, at the peak itself, was the\n  immense visage of Karzoug himself, carved into the mountaintop. Debates on what to do with this massive relic of the\n  past (destroy it, remake it in Sorshen’s image, or revert it to the mountain’s original shape) have vexed the city for\n  years, but so far, Sorshen’s preference to leave Karzoug’s face there as a combination of trophy and reminder has\n  prevailed. In any event, the buildings in the Rising District are largely unoccupied and lie beyond the protective\n  wards in the lower city—here, the death zone of the mountain’s heights rule, and very few things can live for long.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"no-toc\" data-split-here>Downtime in Xin-Eurythnia</h3>\n<p>\n  When you start Revenge of the Runelords—perhaps even before then, if your group does a Session Zero where everyone\n  gets together to get to know each other’s players and to prepare for the upcoming campaign—your PCs can pursue one of\n  the following six special downtime activities. While each of these downtime activities is loosely associated with one\n  of the six rare character backgrounds introduced earlier in this Player’s Guide, you don’t have to engage with the\n  downtime activity that matches your background. Since these activities require skill checks to complete, you should\n  wait until the game starts to pursue them. Normally, each PC gets to attempt one of these downtime activities, but\n  with your GM’s permission you might be able to attempt additional ones—either before the campaign begins or soon\n  thereafter. Note that these downtime activities are relatively risk-free to try, but regardless, once you succeed at\n  any one of these downtime activities, you treat any further critical successes as regular successes—you can only ever\n  earn one magical item as a reward from these downtime activities.\n</p>\n<section class=\"action\">\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Spread Word of Your Homeland</h2>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait uncommon\">uncommon</li>\n\n    <li class=\"trait\">Auditory</li>\n\n    <li class=\"trait\">Concentrate</li>\n\n    <li class=\"trait\">Downtime</li>\n\n    <li class=\"trait\">Linguistic</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p class=\"no-indent\">\n    As a newcomer to Xin-Eurythnia, you’ll find that this isn’t unusual, as most of the city’s inhabitants come from\n    far-flung parts of the world. As a result, trading stories of homelands has become something of a tradition at\n    social\n    gatherings, or simply as a form of small talk while out drinking, eating, or shopping.

Xin-Eurythnia’s a relatively new city housed in the\n    bones of an ancient one, and as such its populace’s traditions are a mishmash of exported festivals and pastimes\n    from\n    across the world... yet one thing seems the same regardless: the appreciation of heroic feats and demonstrations of\n    physical prowess. Games where participants test their might against contraptions meant to measure strength,\n    good-natured wrestling matches, or sports matches or races where people compete for prizes alone or as part of a\n    team—you spend the day testing your strength in between regaling anyone who listens with stories of your heroic\n    past.\n    Attempt a DC 30 Athletics check.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"hanging-indent\">\n    <strong>Critical Success</strong> You not only wow the onlookers, but one game you win nets you an impressive prize.\n    You gain one common level 12 (or lower) magic weapon of your choice.

Here, you can explore local artists’ paintings,\n    sculptures, and more or browse through larger exhibitions put on by various churches or guilds. There’s a friendly\n    air\n    of competition among these artists, and many of them have taken to incorporating religious themes from a wide range\n    of\n    faiths into their work. You spend the day exploring these galleries and chatting with the artists.

They might be practicing wizards, professors of magical\n    theory, or collectors of esoterica, but all these scholars often engage in lively debates in public forums where\n    they\n    present theories for their peers to review, deconstruct, or (as every scholar here seems to hope) be astounded by.\n    While listening to these debates can be entertaining, you can spend the day taking part in them—providing critiques\n    to\n    others in your field or presenting your own theories for others to engage in.

Despite\n    the\n    city’s restoration, there remain parts where this work has yet to be undertaken, particularly in some of the\n    underground regions accessible through caverns lining the valley walls or hidden in abandoned structures’ basements.\n    Here, clues about the strengths and weaknesses of the runelords of eras past might still await discovery—even if it\n    wasn’t Runelord Karzoug who directly impacted your life, his spies surely kept detailed records on his enemies. With\n    the preservative magic that all Thassilonian sites seem to enjoy, you might just be able to discover something\n    carved\n    on a wall, hidden in a secret vault, or whispered by a long-dead ghost, but you need to know where to look. So many\n    of\n    the underground reaches of this region have been reworked or reshaped by the passage of time (and ancient flow of\n    lava) that you find yourself having to rely upon your knowledge of the natural world in order to seek out clues. You\n    spend the day exploring remote parts of the city, then attempt a DC 30 Nature check.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"hanging-indent\">\n    <strong>Critical Success</strong> While exploring these old parts of the city, you made an astounding discovery. A\n    section of stone seemed hollow, but it broke apart with a single light blow to reveal the long-dead remains of a\n    skeleton within. The skeleton crumbled to dust at once, leaving behind the armor it once wore. Almost as if fate\n    took\n    a role in its discovery, this armor is just your size! You gain common level 12 (or lower) suit of magic armor of\n    your\n    choice. If you choose a suit of magic armor with multiple runes that are each lower than level 12, the combined\n    value\n    of the armor you choose must be equal to or less than 2,000 gp.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"hanging-indent\">\n    <strong>Success</strong> Your explorations may not have resulted in the discoveries you hoped to find, but the\n    process of doing so\n    gave\n    you a few hours to reflect and relax, at least!\n  </p>\n</section>"
