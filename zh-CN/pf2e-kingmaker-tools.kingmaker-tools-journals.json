Source Code.</p><p>  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work</p><p>for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source</p><p>form of a work.</p><p>  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official</p><p>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</p><p>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</p><p>is widely used among developers working in that language.</p><p>  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other</p><p>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</p><p>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</p><p>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</p><p>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</p><p>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</p><p>\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component</p><p>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</p><p>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</p><p>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p><p>  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all</p><p>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</p><p>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</p><p>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's</p><p>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</p><p>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</p><p>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</p><p>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</p><p>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</p><p>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</p><p>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</p><p>subprograms and other parts of the work.</p><p>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</p><p>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</p><p>Source.</p><p>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</p><p>same work.</p><p>  2. Basic Permissions.</p><p>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</p><p>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</p><p>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</p><p>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</p><p>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</p><p>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</p><p>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p><p>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</p><p>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</p><p>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</p><p>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</p><p>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</p><p>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</p><p>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</p><p>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</p><p>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</p><p>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p><p>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</p><p>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</p><p>makes it unnecessary.</p><p>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p><p>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</p><p>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</p><p>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</p><p>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</p><p>measures.</p><p>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</p><p>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</p><p>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</p><p>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</p><p>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's</p><p>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of</p><p>technological measures.</p><p>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p><p>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you</p><p>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</p><p>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</p><p>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</p><p>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</p><p>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</p><p>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p><p>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</p><p>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p><p>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p><p>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</p><p>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</p><p>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><p>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</p><p>    it, and giving a relevant date.</p><p>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</p><p>    released under this License and any conditions added under section</p><p>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</p><p>    \"keep intact all notices\".</p><p>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</p><p>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</p><p>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</p><p>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</p><p>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</p><p>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</p><p>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p><p>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</p><p>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</p><p>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</p><p>    work need not make them do so.</p><p>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</p><p>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</p><p>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</p><p>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</p><p>\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</p><p>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users</p><p>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</p><p>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</p><p>parts of the aggregate.</p><p>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p><p>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p><p>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p><p>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p><p>in one of these ways:</p><p>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p><p>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p><p>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p><p>    customarily used for software interchange.</p><p>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p><p>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p><p>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p><p>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p><p>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p><p>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p><p>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p><p>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p><p>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p><p>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p><p>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p><p>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p><p>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</p><p>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p><p>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p><p>    with subsection 6b.</p><p>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p><p>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p><p>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p><p>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</p><p>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</p><p>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p><p>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p><p>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p><p>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p><p>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</p><p>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p><p>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p><p>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p><p>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p><p>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p><p>    charge under subsection 6d.</p><p>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p><p>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p><p>included in conveying the object code work.</p><p>  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any</p><p>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p><p>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p><p>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p><p>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</p><p>product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a</p><p>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p><p>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p><p>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</p><p>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p><p>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p><p>the only significant mode of use of the product.</p><p>  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,</p><p>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p><p>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p><p>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</p><p>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p><p>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p><p>modification has been made.</p><p>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p><p>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p><p>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p><p>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p><p>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p><p>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p><p>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</p><p>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p><p>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p><p>been installed in ROM).</p><p>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p><p>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p><p>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p><p>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</p><p>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p><p>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p><p>protocols for communication across the network.</p><p>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p><p>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p><p>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</p><p>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</p><p>unpacking, reading or copying.</p><p>  7. Additional Terms.</p><p>  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this</p><p>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p><p>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p><p>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p><p>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</p><p>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</p><p>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</p><p>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p><p>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p><p>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p><p>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</p><p>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</p><p>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</p><p>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p><p>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</p><p>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</p><p>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p><p>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</p><p>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p><p>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</p><p>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</p><p>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p><p>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</p><p>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</p><p>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p><p>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</p><p>    authors of the material; or</p><p>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</p><p>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p><p>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</p><p>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</p><p>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</p><p>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</p><p>    those licensors and authors.</p><p>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further</p><p>restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</p><p>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</p><p>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</p><p>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</p><p>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</p><p>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</p><p>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</p><p>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p><p>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</p><p>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</p><p>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</p><p>where to find the applicable terms.</p><p>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p><p>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p><p>the above requirements apply either way.</p><p>  8. Termination.</p><p>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p><p>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p><p>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p><p>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p><p>paragraph of section 11).</p><p>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p><p>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p><p>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p><p>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p><p>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p><p>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p><p>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p><p>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p><p>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p><p>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p><p>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p><p>your receipt of the notice.</p><p>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p><p>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p><p>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p><p>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p><p>material under section 10.</p><p>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p><p>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p><p>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p><p>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p><p>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</p><p>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p><p>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</p><p>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p><p>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p><p>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p><p>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p><p>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p><p>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</p><p>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p><p>  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an</p><p>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p><p>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</p><p>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p><p>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p><p>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p><p>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p><p>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p><p>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p><p>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p><p>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</p><p>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p><p>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p><p>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p><p>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p><p>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p><p>  11. Patents.</p><p>  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p><p>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</p><p>work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".</p><p>  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims</p><p>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p><p>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p><p>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p><p>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p><p>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</p><p>purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant</p><p>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p><p>this License.</p><p>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p><p>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p><p>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p><p>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p><p>  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express</p><p>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p><p>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p><p>sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a</p><p>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p><p>patent against the party.</p><p>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p><p>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p><p>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p><p>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p><p>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p><p>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p><p>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p><p>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p><p>license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have</p><p>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p><p>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p><p>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p><p>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p><p>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p><p>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p><p>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p><p>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p><p>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p><p>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p><p>work and works based on it.</p><p>  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within</p><p>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p><p>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p><p>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</p><p>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p><p>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p><p>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p><p>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p><p>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p><p>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p><p>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p><p>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p><p>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p><p>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p><p>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p><p>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p><p>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p><p>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p><p>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p><p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p><p>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</p><p>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p><p>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p><p>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p><p>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p><p>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p><p>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p><p>  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.</p><p>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the</p><p>Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users</p><p>interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version</p><p>supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding</p><p>Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source</p><p>from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary</p><p>means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source</p><p>shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3</p><p>of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the</p><p>following paragraph.</p><p>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p><p>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p><p>under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single</p><p>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</p><p>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p><p>but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version</p><p>3 of the GNU General Public License.</p><p>  14. Revised Versions of this License.</p><p>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</p><p>the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions</p><p>will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p><p>address new problems or concerns.</p><p>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</p><p>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General</p><p>Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the</p><p>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</p><p>version or of any later version published by the Free Software</p><p>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</p><p>GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</p><p>by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</p><p>versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's</p><p>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</p><p>to choose that version for the Program.</p><p>  Later license versions may give you additional or different</p><p>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</p><p>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</p><p>later version.</p><p>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p><p>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p><p>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</p><p>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY</p><p>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</p><p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p><p>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</p><p>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</p><p>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p><p>  16.

You launch it exclusively with the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.1LmPW2OlHgJvedY8]{View Kingdom} Macro.</p><p>On first launch, it copies an actor with the name <strong>Kingdom Sheet</strong> into your actors folder. This actor is used to store the sheet data and can be placed anywhere but you must not change its name. Then proceed with configuring the sheet:</p><ol><li><p>Edit the <strong>Kingdom Sheet</strong> actor's permissions in Foundry's <strong>Actors</strong> tab by right clicking on the kingdom sheet actor. Set every PC as <strong>Owner</strong> if you want them to change values on the sheet, otherwise choose <strong>Observer</strong></p></li><li><p>Fill in the details in the <strong>Status</strong> tab. Leaders need to be drag and dropped from the actors sidebar and must be either a <strong>Character</strong> or <strong>NPC</strong>. If you are playing with the companion guide, make sure to set the appropriate invested bonus (or the leader type drop down when using V&amp;K Leadership Bonuses)</p></li><li><p>Configure your hex map in the <strong>Status</strong> tab:</p><p>First you need to decide which method you use for tracking kingdom size, worksites and farmlands. By default, the <strong>Official Module</strong> is configured. You can set the preferred method in your kingdom sheet settings:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Official Module</strong>: take worksites, farmlands and kingdom size from the official module's hex map</p></li><li><p><strong>Manual</strong>: manually configure your worksites, farmlands and kingdom size in the <strong>Status</strong> tab</p></li><li><p><strong>Tile/Drawing Based</strong>: associate selected drawings/tiles with meta information using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.tsqRp4OXdkrzRajS]{Edit Realm Tile/Drawing} macro; claimed hex tiles/drawings placed on a configured scene increase your size, worksite and farmland tiles placed inside the claimed hex tiles/drawings increase their respective values. The example image below shows drawings that were made using the <strong>Draw Polygon</strong> tool and have a pattern background image configured.</p><ul><li><p>View your hexmap scene, then scroll to the bottom of the <strong>Status</strong> tab and click the <strong>Set Stolen Lands Hex Map to Current Scene</strong></p></li><li><p>Edit the Scene configuration: in the <strong>Basics</strong> tab, change <strong>Permissions</strong> from <strong>GM Only</strong> to <strong>All Players</strong></p></li></ul><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/docs/images/tilebased.png\" /></li></ul></li><li><p>Set the appropriate skill proficiencies in the <strong>Skills</strong> and feats in the <strong>Feats</strong> tab.</p></li><li><p>Import or create a capital settlement scene. This module ships a few example scenes that come with pre-configured settlement block tiles. If you wish to use your own scenes, be sure to read up on how automatic block tile calculation is implemented in the <strong>Settlements</strong> and <strong>Structures</strong> section further below!</p></li><li><p>Import all structures from the <strong>Structures</strong> compendium</p></li><li><p>Drag and drop the <strong>Townhall</strong> structure from Foundry's <strong>Actors</strong> tab onto a block in your capital scene</p></li><li><p>While viewing your capital scene, go into <strong>Settlements</strong> tab and click <strong>Add Current Scene</strong>.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/docs/images/settlements-tab.png\" /></li><li><p>Edit the added settlement and change the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Capital</strong></p></li></ol><p>Now you are able to run your first kingdom turn. Change to the <strong>Turn</strong> tab.</p><p>Actions flow from top to bottom if they are numbered. the <strong>?</strong> buttons will open the activities description. If there are more than 1 button per line, you need to make a choice.</p><p>Make sure to set the <strong>Active Settlement</strong> in the sidebar to the settlement the PCs are in or where the kingdom event to resolve takes place. At the end of the Kingdom Turn, hit the <strong>End Turn</strong> button. This will move all values in their <strong>Next</strong> columns to their <strong>Now</strong> ones.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/docs/images/turn.png\" /><h2>Settlements</h2><p>Settlements are created as scenes on which you can place structure tokens. Before being able to use a settlement, you first need to add it to your <strong>Settlements</strong> in your kingdom sheet. First, change to the <strong>Settlements</strong> tab, then click <strong>Add Current Scene</strong></p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/docs/images/settlements-tab.png\" /><p>This module ships a <strong>Settlement Scenes</strong> compendium which contains 5 settlement types:</p><ul><li><p>One with no water borders</p></li><li><p>4 with 1-4 water borders</p></li></ul><p>All scenes come with block tiles, onto which you can place your structures. These tiles use a special flag to not accidentally consider your own tiles as blocks. You can place them on your own scenes by simply copying it over and modifying them to your liking.</p><p>You can resize the tiles, change their background image, but you must not rotate them. Only rectangular shapes will work. The module ships a 1x4 and 4x1 tile at the same location as the 2x2 image that you can use to spice things ups.</p><p>By default, placing a structure into a block automatically increases the settlement's level. If you do not want this kind of automation, you can turn it off in the kingdom sheet settings. You can also disable it on per scene basis in the settlement configuration.</p><h2>Structures</h2><p>Structures are implemented as NPC stat blocks, including the correct sizes. Their description is in the public notes. You will need to import all structures from the Structures compendium to make them show up in the Build Structure activity popup. The module will include all structures in your game in that window, so you can create custom structures as well.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/docs/images/structures.png\" /><p>All structures in a settlement can be automatically summed up and calculated and can be viewed in your settlements tab by clicking the Inspect button.</p><p>Settlement level is calculated by placing structure tokens on special block tiles that are included in the <strong>Settlement Scenes </strong>compendium. If you wish to use your own scenes, import a single scene, copy the block tile to your own scene and, if required, change the background image.</p><p>You can set the <strong>Slowed</strong> condition after a <strong>Build Structure</strong> <strong>Failure</strong> to indicate that construction is delayed. It will be excluded from all modifier calculations.</p><p>If you want to home brew structure rules, you can use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.DNVjHLroQKfN8y4V]{Edit Structure Rules} Macro.</p><p>A guide on structure rules can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/BernhardPosselt/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/blob/master/docs/structure-rules.md\">GitHub Repo</a> and requires the use of JSON.</p><h2>Automation Notes</h2><ul><li><p>Many Kingdom Feats are not fully automated. You can check that by taking a look at the Auto column in the Feats tab. Details are visible by hovering over the <strong>(x)</strong> symbol with your cursor.</p></li></ul>"

                    "name": "Camping",
                    "text": "<h2>Usage</h2><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/camping-activities.webp\" /><p>The basic idea of the sheet is to make camping incredibly fast by:</p><ul><li>keeping previous camp assignments &amp; meal choices</li><li>showing players and GMs if all activities have been performed</li><li>automatically managing Camping and Meal effects</li><li>automating resource management like rations and ingredients</li><li>allowing you to easily override degrees of successes</li></ul><p>First, drag the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.GXeKz3qKlsoxcaTg]{Camping} Macro into your macro bar and run it once. This will create an actor called <strong>Camping Sheet</strong> in your actor directory. Do not rename or delete it since it will be used to store and retrieve data. The data is persisted on the actor's flags property which is not visible to users by opening the default actor sheet.</p><h3>Adding Camping Actors</h3><p>To add actors to your camp, drag and drop them onto the actor list.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/tutorial/2.webp\" /><p>You can add the following actors:</p><ul><li><p>characters</p></li><li><p>npcs</p></li><li><p>vehicles</p></li><li><p>loot</p></li></ul><p>but only characters will be able to perform checks and consume meals. Because effect syncing is a very slow process, it is <strong>highly discouraged to add all companion actors to the sheet. </strong>Instead, enable their activities in the sheet's settings. The only companion activity that can't be enabled that way is <strong>Camp Management</strong> (because it requires a check). Simply add the companion for that specific activity if required.</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Note, that users can't drag and drop their own actors from the sidebar by default, so the GM needs to pre-populate it.</p><h3>Hexploration and Time Tracking</h3><p>The sheet automatically calculates your hexploration activities based on the speed of your party actor. You can override the minimum speed by setting the <strong>Minimum Travel Speed</strong> in the sheet's settings (e.g. 40 to simulate horses).</p><p>Clicking the hex icon will advance or retract 1 Hexploration Activitiy. Remaining Hexploration Activities are shown in <strong>Hex. Activities</strong> and are calculated based on the time listed in <strong>Adventuring</strong>. Passing even a single second at the start of the day will therefore reduce your Hexploration activities as RAW.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/time-tracker.webp\" /><h3>Random Encounters</h3><p>Random encounters are managed at the very top by selecting the region drop down and changing the <strong>Encounter DC</strong> modifier if necessary. They are automatically rolled during rest but can be rolled during the day as well by clicking on the skull and dice button. If you don't want to perform a flat check hit the skull button instead.</p><p>Roll Tables are configured in the sheet's region configuration.</p><p>Keep in mind that the <strong>Encounter DC</strong> is not only modified by the encounter modifier, but also by chosen activities like <strong>Blend into the Night</strong>.</p><p>The rules mention that you increase the Encounter DC for each hour spent during camp and perform a random encounter check. This is widely regarded as a mistake and therefore isn't automated. If you wish to follow RAW, you need manually increase the modifier and check for encounters.</p><p>Out of the box, the official module only ships combat encounters. If you want to roll non combat encounters as well, you can use a <strong>Proxy Random Encounter Table</strong> which is configured in the sheet's settings. The proxy table can roll on subtables based on a formula or the configured roll table for the current region by setting <strong>Result Type</strong> to <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Result Details</strong> to <strong>Creature</strong>.</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/docs/images/random-encounter-proxy-table.png\" /><h3>Prepare Campsite</h3><p>When you open up the sheet, the only activity that can be chosen is Prepare Campsite. Drag an actor from the actor list:</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/actor-list.webp\" /><p>onto the Prepare Campsite Tile:</p><img src=\"modules/pf2e-kingmaker-tools/img/camping/docs/prepare-campsite.webp\" /><p>To fill the activity. After rolling the check, a Failure, Success or Critical Success automatically advances the sheet to the <strong>Camping Activities</strong> section and syncs the effects. Otherwise clicking on the <strong>&gt;</strong> button will immediately move to the Eating section. Because no actor had the chance to cook a meal, all meal buttons will be disabled.</p><p>You can track existing campsites on a hex map by setting a <strong>Hexploration Scene</strong> in the sheet's settings. This will save the current party token position and Prepare Campsite degree of success (other than Critical Failure) on the map. If you prepare campsite in the same hex again, you will be asked whether you want to reuse a previous result.</p><h3>Camping Activities</h3><p>In order to perform camping activities, you have to set <strong>Prepare Campsite</strong> to a result other than <strong>Critical Failure</strong> or <strong>-</strong>. Otherwise the <strong>&gt;</strong> button will jump straight to <strong>Eating</strong>.</p><p>To select camping activities, drag and drop your actor from the actor list onto an activity tile. Actors that do not fulfill the minimum proficiency requirements can't select the activity. You can disable this behavior in the settings.</p><p>Most of the existing activities are hidden and can be enabled in <strong>Activities</strong> in the sheet's settings.</p><p>After an activity result has been chosen, its effects are automatically applied to PCs. For this reason you want to complete actions like <strong>Tell Campfire Story</strong> before performing other activities. You can also quickly choose a different result. The previous effects will be removed if necessary, new ones will be applied immediately.</p><p>Some actions like Amiri's <strong>Enhance Weapons</strong> only apply to combat and can't be easily applied to PCs. The will be posted to chat if a random encounter happens during rest.</p><p>If you want to simulate companions taking their actions while in camp, you can enable their activities in the settings to prevent cluttering the activity section. Toggled activities will always be enabled and filtered from the activity selection section.</p><h3>Eating</h3><p>Each character in camp is available in the <strong>Eating</strong> section where you can choose their food for the day. To select a meal, simply drag and drop your actor from the top actor list onto a meal. It will remove the actor from whatever meal was chosen before.</p><p><strong>Favorite Meal</strong>s are configured in the sheet's settings menu. Only actors owned by each PC will be available for selection, but keep in mind that all actors listed in the popup will be updated on a save, potentially overriding saved values from other players. Ideally, no actor is owned by more than one character, but if that's the case, players will need to open the favorite meal popup one after another.</p><p><strong>Subsist</strong> is automated as a Macro: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.0NhBWcZQf1GHp73f]{Subsist: Provisions} which will add an item called \"Provisions\" to your inventory. Those items are consumed before Rations and are removed after Resting.</p><p>Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mt6ZzkVX8Q4xigFq] or other features that create rations can be handled by running the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.7MrkVVB6D6UrdtA1] Macro. This macro adds a set number of <strong>Provisions</strong> to the party actor. If you want to automate this, you can set a minimum subsistence in the settings which is added after resting.</p><p>If a PC has chosen the <strong>Cook Meal</strong> activity and <strong>Prepare Campsite</strong> wasn't a Critical Failure, you will be able to perform the check by clicking on the roll button; otherwise the form elements are disabled. Rolling a check will automatically fill in the degree of success and post the buttons to consume ingredients and apply effects to chat. Contrary to camping activities, meal effects are not automatically synced to PCs, because they persist beyond your camping session and because they can stack. For example: you could suffer the Critical Failure from <strong>Discover Special Meal</strong> and then consume a <strong>Basic Meal</strong>.</p><p>The total amount of all carried ingredients and the total amount of consumed ingredients for uncooked recipes (recipes without a result) is listed to the right. There is no automation in place to prevent you from consuming more ingredients than you carry.</p><h3>Resting</h3><p>Rest duration is affected by the following parameters:</p><ul><li>Number of all actors in camp that are enabled in the watch rest settings, plus</li><li><strong>Increase actors keeping watch</strong> rest setting, plus</li><li>1 if <strong>Organize Watch</strong> was a Critical Success, plus</li><li><strong>Fish-on-a-Stick</strong> rest duration effects</li><li><strong>Guns To Clean</strong> setting (affects Daily Preparations)</li></ul><p>You can start a rest by hitting the <strong>Begin Rest</strong> button.</p><p>If you've set a playlist it will be played. If you want to play it only once, then set the <strong>Playback Mode</strong> to <strong>Soundboard Only</strong>.</p><p>By default, one random encounter will be rolled automatically during rest. This can be changed to one every 4 hours (RAW) or none in the sheet's settings. If an encounter occurs, a random point in time between now and the end of the rest will be chosen and time will automatically advance to that point in time. Afterward, a random camping character who is not marked to <strong>Skip Watch</strong> in the sheet's settings will prompt you for a secret Perception check. All companion activities that impose effects on enemies or allies will be published to chat</p><p>Once you finish the random encounter, you can continue the rest by pressing <strong>Continue</strong>. No more random encounters will happen. Time will advance to after your daily preparations.</p><p>Then the following things happen:</p><ul><li>All camping effects will be removed</li><li>All meal effects that expire after resting will be removed</li><li>All damaging or healing meal effects will be rolled and, if possible, applied automatically</li><li>The <strong>Rest for the Night</strong> macro will be executed for all actors in the sidebar</li><li>Additional healing received from <strong>Basic Meal</strong> and <strong>Healers's Blessing</strong> will be applied as will <strong>Shepherd's Pie</strong>'s halving on a critical failure. Doubling and halving healing will cancel out, regardless of how many effects would apply.</li><li>All <strong>Provisions</strong> items will be removed</li><li>All camping activity results are reset to <strong>-</strong></li><li>The <strong>Adventuring</strong> tracker will be reset</li></ul><h2>Automation Notes</h2><p>Meal effects and consumables such as rations are tracked by their name, so <strong>if you rename Rations, ingredients or effects, tracking will be broken</strong>. Compared to RAW, the following rules are not automated:</p><h3>General</h3><ul><li>The encounter DC modifier is not being increased/decreased/reset automatically. Many people have issues with frequency and likelihood of random encounter checks, so we leave this up to the GM.</li><li>For a similar reason, time is not advanced automatically when performing camping activities</li><li>The rules mention that each PC can take exploration actions as desired during Prepare Campsite and Camping Activities. Since these are GM fiat, they aren't implemented on the sheet. Simply open the character sheet and roll the checks manually, choosing the appropriate modifiers</li><li>Fatigued is not applied automatically since automating would more than likely be annoying and there are too many feats and meals to keep track of that change the duration to become fatigued.</li></ul><h3>Camping Activities</h3><ul><li><strong>Camp Management</strong>: There is no concept of sequential activities</li><li><strong>Cook</strong>: RAW, each meal is prepared by a separate cook and ingredients are expended before rolling the check. Currently, only one cook is supported who cooks all of the meals after camping activities are done</li><li><strong>Relax</strong>: Depends on sequential activities and, since this action can be taken by everyone and depends on the order, only a <strong>Relaxed</strong> camping effect is available in the Camping Effects compendium. If you wish to, you can create a custom activity for each PC and give it the Effect UUIDs of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-camping-effects.Item.QvR2yvuIVQuztCwQ]{Relaxed}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-camping-effects.Item.zliIP2agG0TVwKV4]{Relaxed (+1 to next campig check)} and Effect Target <strong>Self</strong> which handles all of the automation</li><li><strong>Provide Aid</strong>: Roll this one as a separate check from your character sheet and apply the circumstance bonus for the roll separately</li><li><strong>Exploration Activities</strong>: Activities that can be taken by more than one PC such as Exploration Activities are not supported since they require a different way of tracking time and have no clear way of automating them. You can execute these directly from your PC's sheet instead</li></ul><h3>Eating</h3><ul><li>Starvation &amp; Fatigue are not tracked</li></ul><h3>Meals</h3><ul><li><p>All meals are automated as much as possible but you will need to manually take care of:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Reducing Conditions</strong>: Can not be done automatically because it is not 100% clear whether you are even allowed to reduce a condition. For instance Encumbered adds the Clumsy 1 condition but reducing it after consuming a meal is almost certainly wrong. The same applies for Curses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Apply damage</strong>: There are no 2e system APIs that allow you to deal damage without a token</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The following traits are lacking from their effects because the 2e system does not support traits on effects. These are important for spells and items that remove conditions limited to these traits such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SUKaxVZW2TlM8lu0]{Cleanse Affliction}:</p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong>Poison</strong>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Baked Spider (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Broiled Tuskwater (Oysters Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Grilled Silver Eel (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Haggis (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Hearty Purple Soup (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Mastodon Steak (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Onion Soup (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Omelet (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Seasoned Wings And Thighs (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Smoked Trout And Hydra Pate (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Succulent Sausages (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Sweet Pancakes (Critical Failure)</span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\"><strong>Curse</strong>:</span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Black Linnorm Stew: (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Supernatural Mince Pie: (Critical Failure)</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Rice-N-Nut Pudding: (Critical Failure)</span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>"

Since I've been wanting to resolve licensing issues when combining CUP and AGPL content for quite a while now, this was a perfect opportunity to go OGL only.</p><p>This required me to scrub any mention of Paizo IP from the module, including the module name itself, which is now <strong>Kingdom Building, Camping &amp; Weather. </strong>This should also clear up confusion that I've seen many times about whether you need to the official or unofficial module<strong>.</strong></p><p>In almost all instances, functionality was kept intact by simply renaming offending content. However, there are 2 exceptions to this:</p><ul><li><p>I do not ship companion actor statblocks anymore that weren't previously included. This was more of a maintability issue since the core system changes frequently and automation is not automatically migrated most of the time. Also, the Remaster didn't help</p></li><li><p>The Kingdom Sheet lost automation for appointing companions as leaders. Previously, the sheet automatically toggled the invested checkbox and enabled their features and activities when they were placed in the correct slot. This required override toggles in the settings to undo automation. It was a choice between keeping the old system and renaming the companions (e.g. Cleric Companion 1, Cleric Companion 2) or streamlining it. Now, everything works the same: you need to manually toggle the invested checkbox and enable companion activities like every other disabled activity</p></li><li><p>The Camping Sheet no longer ships Influence/Discover activities for each companion due to similar issues.

Instead, you whitelist their activities like all other activities under the <strong>Manage Activities</strong> button in the <strong>Turn</strong> tab. You will need to manually toggle the <strong>Invested</strong> checkbox. Some companions provide benefits that need to be enabled in the settings instead. You might need to enable/disable their companion activities or invested flags after upgrading</p></li><li><p>Some activities have been renamed (the temple and lily leadership activities) and might need to be manually disabled/enabled</p></li><li><p>Mentions of Paizo IP in Kingdom Events and Kingdom Activities have been removed or reworded</p></li></ul><h3>Camping Sheet</h3><ul><li><p>Region names are Paizo IP so you will need to configure all Region names manually in the camping region settings. If you have the official module enabled, Combat Tracks &amp; Roll Tables will be prefilled.</p></li><li><p>Some Recipes mentioned Paizo IP.

However, you can now configure a DC per Skill when adding custom camping activities, allowing you to fully stat out the entire array of Influence/Discover checks</p></li></ul><h3>Journal Entries</h3><ul><li><p>Many entries were removed since they were duplicated in the sheets anyways and removing Paizo IP was work intensive</p></li></ul><h2>Tokens</h2><ul><li><p>All GMG NPC mappings have been removed to prepare for the arrival of NPC Core. Imported actors should continue to work, but there will be no image when browsing the Compendium Browser</p></li></ul><h2>New Feature: Camping Sheet Overhaul</h2><ul><li><p>When a new camping sheet is created, it automatically makes all players owners of the sheet to avoid permission issues and displays a quickstart manual to get you going</p></li><li><p>The sheet now calculates Hexploration Activities and allows you to advance or retract a single activity. You can set a minimum speed in the sheet's settings to mimic travel using horses.</p></li><li><p>Camp locations can now be tracked on a hex map. Choose a Hexploration Scene in settings to enable it. The party token position on the map is persisted after Prepare Campsite and will ask you to reuse an existing camp (if one exists). This uses a naive implementation of simply checking token coordinates changing the hex grid will require you to clear existing positions.</p></li><li><p>You can now configure all regions, including their combat tracks and types. New terrain types like Urban and Dungeon have been added to allow you to use the sheet in non hexploration campaigns as well</p></li><li><p>You can now configure the climate in the module settings, allowing you to set custom weather for each month</p></li><li><p>Combat Tracks can now reference a track in addition to a playlists</p></li><li><p>All combat tracks are now configured solely in the Camping Sheet. You don't need to create tracks with special names anymore and existing region tracks are ignored.</p></li><li><p>Companion activities that don't require a check can now be toggled in the camping sheet. This helps keeping the sheet clean and performant if you want to simulate travel with all companions</p></li><li><p>All recipes have been automated as much as possible. The only thing that was not possible to automate was applying damage (no 2e system APIs for that) and the reduction of conditions because those depend on context (e.g. can't reduce Clumsy when Encumbered or conditions from curses). This will post messages and damage to chat to apply them manually</p></li><li><p>Each PC can now choose more than one meal (RAW) but there is still only one designated cook as opposed to RAW.</p></li><li><p>Meal effects are now removed when preparing camp (RAW)</p></li><li><p>Subsist is now fully automated as a macro @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.0NhBWcZQf1GHp73f]{Subsist: Provisions}. This macro adds <strong>Privisions</strong> items to an actor's inventory which get consumed before rations and is removed after resting</p></li><li><p>Similarly, there is now a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-kingmaker-tools.kingmaker-tools-macros.Macro.7MrkVVB6D6UrdtA1]{Create Food} macro that adds Provisions to the party actor. Use this to automate spells such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Mt6ZzkVX8Q4xigFq]{Create Food}. You can also set a minimum subsistence in the settings to automatically gain this amount after resting.</p></li><li><p>Changing the degree of success dropdown for activities as well as recipes posts all associated messages to chat now</p></li></ul>"
