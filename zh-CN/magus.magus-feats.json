The creature takes 1d4 force damage per level of the spell and must attempt a basic Fortitude save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save are also immobilized for 1 round.</li>\n<li><strong>咒法系</strong> (teleportation) The creature is blinked between existence, rupturing its form. The creature must attempt a basic Fortitude save against your spell DC and takes 1d4 bludgeoning and 1d4 slashing damage per level of the spell. On a failed save, the creature must attempt a DC 5 flat check to use actions with the manipulate trait for 1 round as they phase in and out of existence.</li>\n<li><strong>预言系</strong> (emotion, fear, mental) The creature sees a vision of their death. The creature takes 1d6 mental damage per spell level of the spell and must attempt a basic Will save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save are frightened 1 or frightened 2 on a critical failure.</li>\n<li><strong>惑控系</strong> (mental) The creature's mind is bound to a mental prison. The creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save are stupefied 2 for 1 round, or confused for 1 round on a critical failure. If a creature would gain the dying condition from the Spellstrike that caused this effect, the duration of the confused and stupefied conditions increases to permanent, but the creature can attempt a new save against the effect each day.</li>\n<li><strong>塑能系</strong> The creature is blasted with essence manipulation. The creature takes an additional amount of damage from your Spellstrike equal to the level of the spell you cast and must attempt a basic Reflex save. Determine the damage type as described in Arcane Cascade. Creatures that fail their save also apply a weakness to the damage type equal to the spell's level or reduce any resistances they have to the damage type by the same amount. If a creature with immunity to the damage type fails their save, they take half damage of that damage type. This effect occurs at the same time as the Spellstrike and applies any weaknesses or reductions in resistances to the Spellstrike's damage if they would apply.</li>\n<li><strong>幻术系</strong> (mental, visual) The creature is absorbed into a false reality. The creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save treat all areas around them as difficult terrain for 1 minute or greater difficult terrain if their save was a critical failure. Any creature that moves through the area or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve this illusion.</li>\n<li><strong>死灵系</strong> (death) The creature is bombarded with a sphere of death. The creature takes 1d8 negative damage per level of the spell or positive damage if the spell had the positive trait and must attempt a Fortitude save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save are also drained 2 and creatures that critically fail their save are drained 4. If a creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points from the damage of this effect or the drained condition, it is instantly slain and attempts to communicate with it, return it to life, turn it into an undead, or otherwise disturb its afterlife fail unless the effect's counteract level is higher than half your level when you killed the creature (rounded up), or originates from an artifact or a deity. If any creature would not be affected by the type of damage dealt by this effect, this effect does not occur for any creature and fizzles, but the effects of the Spellstrike still apply normally.</li>\n<li><strong>变化系</strong> (morph) The creature's inner anatomy is morphed by your shell, causing bodily stress and difficulty operating. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save and becomes sickened 2 on a failure, or sickened 3 on a critical failure. While a creature is sickened they also take a –10- foot status penalty to their Speeds. A creature that is immune to the sickened condition instead takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage per level of the spell on a basic Fortitude save and suffers the status penalty to Speeds for 1 round after taking damage from a failure of this effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat multiple times, gaining the ability to create an additional essence eating spellshell each time you select it.</p>",
