The creature must attempt a Will save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save treat all areas around them as difficult terrain for 1 minute or greater difficult terrain if their save was a critical failure. Any creature that moves through the area or uses the Seek action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve this illusion.</li>\n<li><strong>Necromancy</strong> (death) The creature is bombarded with a sphere of death. The creature takes 1d8 negative damage per level of the spell or positive damage if the spell had the positive trait and must attempt a Fortitude save against your spell DC. Creatures that fail their save are also drained 2 and creatures that critically fail their save are drained 4.

If any creature would not be affected by the type of damage dealt by this effect, this effect does not occur for any creature and fizzles, but the effects of the Spellstrike still apply normally.</li>\n<li><strong>Transmutation</strong> (morph) The creature's inner anatomy is morphed by your shell, causing bodily stress and difficulty operating. The creature must attempt a Fortitude save and becomes sickened 2 on a failure, or sickened 3 on a critical failure. While a creature is sickened they also take a –10- foot status penalty to their Speeds. A creature that is immune to the sickened condition instead takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage per level of the spell on a basic Fortitude save and suffers the status penalty to Speeds for 1 round after taking damage from a failure of this effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat multiple times, gaining the ability to create an additional essence eating spellshell each time you select it.</p>",
