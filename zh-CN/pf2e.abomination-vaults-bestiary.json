They are therefore the most frequently encountered velstracs on the Material Plane, leading covens of hedonistic mortal flesh-sculptors or serving as wardens of horrific dungeons. In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for mortal's souls or choice mortal flesh. Evangelists are the same size as humans, although with the heavy chains that always drape their forms, they often weigh 350 pounds or more.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The search for ultimate sensation through self-mutilation is the horrifying preoccupation of the shadow-dwelling fiends known as velstracs. They transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of torture, or when turning their agonizing practices back on themselves. Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering. These fiends claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don't recognize any refinement that doesn't require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit.</p>\n<p>Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic mortals who are judged and sent on to the Shadow Plane. They take on forms that suit their vile predilections, ranging from the low-ranking augurs to the maestros of suffering and mutilation called eremites. The process of transformation warps the soul step by step, with other velstracs conveying their new members through untold chambers of pain among the dark reaches of the Shadow Plane.</p>",

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>These desert-based will-o'-wisps deal fire damage rather than electricity and delight in setting their victims aflame, relishing the resulting screams that echo across the landscape. They can quench their glow like other will-o'-wisps, but the nearer they remain to their burning victims, the more obvious their heat shimmer appears in the air.</p>",

Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nearly always adherents of the grim deity Groetus, these will-o'-wisps resemble the leering skull-faced moon of their namesake.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>",

The only body of water they avoid is the River Styx, as the fiends have yet to develop any defense against that waterway's memory-sapping qualities. Mortal spellcasters sometimes bind sarglagons as guardians of precious secrets or treasures, particularly in aquatic areas.

Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aquatic will-o'-wisps, will-o'-the-deeps dwell within oceans and even terrestrial lakes, and strings of them can create profoundly beautiful vistas. Their propensity to draw ships toward reefs and whirlpools or to swarm smaller vessels makes them a deadly hazard.</p>",

These regions are often plagued by will-o'-wisps, which seem to have an uncanny relationship with the resident witchfire. A witchfire might visit villages on the edge of their home terrain to lure away villagers, but always attack victims within earshot to make sure that other villagers hear the screams. A witchfire might also ally with other hags or witches and even join their covens, but a witchfire is incapable of forming covens entirely on their own.</p>",
