A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, five of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other five-born with the legs and tails of wolves-traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the first adlets.</p>\n<p>Adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists. Given that, it's little wonder that adlets have developed something of a superiority complex.

            "publicNotes": "<p>An amphisbaena is an exceedingly aggressive, venomous viper of remarkable size that bears two heads-one on each end of its body. It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times.</p>\n<p>Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal.</p>\n<p>The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine.</p>\n<p>The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever。</p>",

These technological organisms first came to Golarion from another world when their starship crashed, scattering wreckage all across Numeria in an event known as the Rain of Stars. Feared by local Kellids and enslaved by the Technic League, androids on Golarion have spent eons being hated and hunted. Many androids survive by adopting human customs and hiding in plain sight, while others become criminals, hermits, or nomads.</p>\n<p>Designed to resemble humans, androids have several distinctive features. Their eyes have a metallic sheen, they rarely fall ill, and they have trouble displaying complex emotions. Circuit-like tattoos decorate their bodies and control internal nanites. When stimulated, these nanites kick their internal chemistry into overdrive, allowing them to function at peak performance that causes their circuitry to glow.</p>\n<p>Androids are created in sophisticated machines called foundries. They emerge as mature adults with newborn souls and no knowledge of their purpose or the world around them. Android bodies don't deteriorate, though their souls age like any other mortal's. When an android feels they've lived a full life, they willingly release their soul to the afterlife, causing their body to shut down and reboot. Once this process, known as Renewal, completes, a new soul inhabits the body.</p>\n<p>Foundry programming produces androids that mimic human anatomy. Numerous android models exist, each designed to excel at different tasks and purposes. Androids of all models display countless variations of coloration, body shapes, and gender identities. Theoretically, a foundry could be reprogrammed to create androids with new adaptations, colorations, and forms-perhaps even in the guise of other ancestries。</p>",

Razor-edged consonite stalactites hum and chime along with the plane's grinding movement. As large collections of these crystals begin to communicate with each other through their shared song, they awaken into a sort of musical collective.</p>\n<p>Eventually, consonite choirs' songs grow loud and complex enough to shake these colonies loose of their stone moorings and free them to explore the Plane of Earth. Consonite choirs typically prefer to stay near their spawning grounds but might be coerced to perform in the homes of wealthy shaitans or serve other powerful creatures of earth. They willingly leave the comfort of their homes to hunt down the hated xorns, who enjoy the flavor of their immobile consonite brethren.</p>\n<p>Consonite choirs who leave the Plane of Earth, either through natural portals or by answering the calls of powerful rituals, often find the open spaces of other planes more to their liking.

In their native caverns, consonite choirs can easily find new members. Trapped elsewhere, they must rely on others for replacement blades or eventually fall into torpor。</p>",

Fresh- and saltwater serve equally well for this purpose, though the creatures generally congregate near oceans and seas for other reasons. Jungles, islands, and warm coastlines are their most common nesting sites, though they usually hide their nests high in trees or in other locations out of easy reach of predators, scavengers, or anything that might steal the trinkets they've collected.</p>\n<p>These little flyers are insatiably curious, and they love to follow humanoids around. Capuchins largely agree that humanoids have the best food and trinkets. Smarter than animals and capable of rudimentary speech, the creatures can be quite useful with the right training, learning how seek out sunken treasures or hunt down rats and other pests on a ship. Some spellcasters residing along tropical coastlines have taken coral capuchins as familiars, though many claim the critters as far more trouble than any benefits they provide are worth. A capuchin familiar might pilfer spellcasting components, gemstones, vials, crafting materials, and other trinkets from their master, though a clever magic user will intersperse more appealing (and less valuable) baubles to draw their familiar's attention away from actually important items.</p>\n<p>Capuchin clans live together under a single matriarch, a slightly larger female who can be identified by her unusually prismatic skin and colorful eyes. These females refuse to be tamed or kept as pets and violently resist all forms of capture. The most powerful among them even possess divine powers which they call upon to protect their homes and kin. In return, the remainder of the clan fights fiercely to protect their matriarch, defending her (and her trinkets) from threats far larger than themselves。</p>",

The few desert giants who mingle in the societies of smaller humanoids don't bother to dispute such ridiculous rumors.</p>\n<p>In fact, desert giants' strong cultural traditions play a large part in their ability to prosper in such harsh environs. Desert giant elders encourage their descendants to maintain abstemious lifestyles, particularly with regard to the consumption of food and drink. Alcohol is particularly disdained by desert giants, who view mind-altering diuretics like liquor and ale as dangerous temptations in an environment as unforgiving as the desert. Instead, most desert giants follow a simple vegetarian diet and maintain an incredible internal map of their home region's seasonal waterways and oases.</p>\n<p>Their austere habits and intolerance for foolishness have earned desert giants a reputation as being ill-humored and no-nonsense, but many of their communities boast a wide variety of humorous tales in their vast oral histories and legends. Since desert giants' journeys across the wastes can span weeks or even months at a time, an individual who can make their companions laugh with a witty joke or amusing parable remains a prized member of the community.</p>\n<p>Desert giants stand 15 feet tall, tending toward lean physiques that are ideal for traveling across vast expanses of sand for long sojourns.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Many kinds of giants lurk in the inhospitable corners of the world, making their homes in unlikely locales ranging from fetid sinkholes and ruined battlefields to mass graveyards and barren badlands。</p>",

Among Darklands communities, most inhabitants regard bore worms much in the same way surface cultures speak of maggots or cockroaches-with general disdain and revulsion. Children consider catching a single bore worm and using it to torment others a rite of passage, albeit a dangerous one.</p>\n<p>An undead sorcerer in the ghoul-run Darklands city of Nemret Noktoria developed necral worms about 60 years ago by filling an empress bore worm's abandoned exoskeleton with a unique alchemical paste. These undead bore worms radiate the very energies of death, making them surprisingly sophisticated magical batteries. Less pleasant entities often use them as magical tools。</p>",

They resemble decaying humanoids, but with elongated arms, teeth, and bone-like spikes protruding from their upper backs. Festrogs' tendency to run on all fours has led to them gaining the moniker dog-ghouls, causing the unwary to mistake them for mindless predators.</p>\n<p>Festrogs are in fact intelligent, stalking victims in packs and choosing hunting grounds that suit their abilities. They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack.</p>\n<p>Researchers of the necromantic processes that creates risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators.</p>\n<p>Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence. In fact, some humanoid festrogs capture and starve beastkin in hopes of the creatures rising as grotesque festrog pets。</p>",

Unlike most other aberrations, flumphs' monstrous appearance belies their true nature as gentle, good-natured creatures whose self-imposed duty is to bolster the defenses of worlds across the multiverse against onslaught from the cosmic horrors of the Dark Tapestry between the stars.</p>\n<p>Flumphs are small, jellyfish-like creatures who normally float about 5 feet off the ground on a self-generated cushion of wind, directing their movements with jets of air from countless tiny pores on the surface of their bodies. With some effort, the flumph can force air through these openings in a way that roughly approximates humanoid speech, albeit in a squeaky and halting tone.</p>\n<p>Though a flumph's underside is ringed with an array of acidic spikes that they use to hunt small prey, they are nearly defenseless against most attackers and usually attempt to flee when threatened. If cornered, a flumph can emit a foul-smelling spray capable of temporarily incapacitating enemies while warning nearby allies of their presence. This olfactory defense mechanism causes flumphs to feel more kinship with terrestrial creatures than with the jellyfish to which they bear a closer physical resemblance.</p>\n<p>Flumphs hatch from pods flung into outer space from the distant flumph homeworld in a ritual known as the Seeding. Even a newly hatched flumph has an instinctive knowledge of their purpose and seeks to make a lair close to a nearby settlement, which they then adopt as their personal charge to protect. However, remaining acutely aware of both their physical limitations and the tendency of their appearance to frighten the unsuspecting, most flumphs recruit and guide from afar, revealing their true nature only to their most trusted allies.</p>\n<p>In addition to their missions, flumphs endeavor to lead upstanding lives on a daily basis. They notably draw guidance from their dreams through exhaustive interpretations and carefully maintained dream journals. Life lessons, areas in which they can improve their behavior, and portents of alien danger all come to flumphs in dreams-or at least, that's what they believe.

Though most comfortable on the forest floor, a porcupine can climb trees adeptly to seek out leaves, bark, and insects for food. The giant porcupine is no less shy than its smaller kin, but these 5-foot-long specimens climb only the ancient old growth of deep forests. Both species are found only in temperate woodlands, though a giant porcupine prefers forests with less undergrowth where it can maneuver more easily. When startled or threatened, a porcupine employs multiple strategies to discourage potential predators. It emits a pungent odor that warns other creatures away, rattling its quills and chattering its teeth loudly to provide an additional auditory warning. If cornered, it raises its quills, faces away from the danger, and charges backwards at full speed, impaling any unlucky creatures is in its path.</p>\n<p>A porcupine's barbed quills-in actuality long, stiff hairs-hook into a foe's flesh. A creature can easily pull free from the porcupine should a creature come into contact with one, but the quill's barbed tips continue to dig into the victim's skin from the creature's own movements. Removing the quills is a painful process, and quills that break off under the skin can sometimes requires a healer's assistance to remove effectively. Contrary to popular belief, however, a porcupine can't shoot its quills, making it a threat only to a creature brazen or foolish enough to attack it directly.</p>\n<p>Porcupines use the same defensive tactics regardless of size, but the giant porcupine is often devastatingly effective given its sheer mass. Fortunately, these creatures tend to flee at the first opportunity to do so.

Merfolk and other underwater cultures often use them as pack animals, while some coastal cultures ride them as mounts. Earning a seahorse's trust can be rather difficult given their skittish nature, but giant seahorses can express incredible loyalty and affection once they bond with someone, even going so far as to risk their own well-beings to defend someone who has earned their trust. They don't take to combat naturally, though, and in dangerous situations, they're more likely to try and grab their rider with their strong, prehensile tails before swimming to safety, rather than staying in a fight. Like smaller seahorses, giant seahorses have bony armor plates on the outside of their bodies, covered by skin, which makes them fairly durable despite their reluctance to battle.</p>\n<p>Though not the strongest swimmers, seahorses rely primarily on natural camouflage to survive. Chromatophores in seahorses' skin allow them to camouflage themselves. This ability is fairly rudimentary, and the size of a giant seahorse makes this tactic far less effective for them than for their smaller kin. Their colors change slowly at most times, though when in a dangerous situation, the process occurs much more rapidly for the seahorse.</p>\n<p>Unlike regular seahorses, giant seahorses also rely on herd tactics for defense as well as their surprising physical strength. A herd of charging seahorses is just as terrifying and dangerous underwater as a herd of stampeding horses on land. Humanoids in underwater cultures learn at a young age to quickly get out of the way of a herd of stampeding seahorses.</p>\n<p>Baby giant seahorses are too big to easily float and lack sufficient strength to swim on their own for several weeks after birth. They instead link tails with an adult and allow themselves to be ferried around. An adult seahorse can carry upwards of 20 seahorse babies hanging from them at once, though these babies might occasionally get left behind or swept away by a strong current. Caring for these helpless, wayward children is seen as a supreme act of kindness by many merfolk, who'll let these babies wrap their tails around staves and other implements and rear them into adulthood。</p>",

Often grouping in committees of four or five, these scavengers wheel above battles and plague‑stricken towns, eager to feed.

Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures. However, during particularly lean times, starving groups of giant vultures might work in unison to make a meal of livestock.</p>\n<p>Giant vultures occasionally form parasitic relationships with larger creatures such as dragons or giants, picking at the remains of an unattended or forgotten meal. Crafters who use bones in their work have come to value this type of behavior. Flensing a creature properly is far slower than letting a committee of vultures strip the carcass and leave behind a clean skeleton. As food-motivated predators, younger vultures raised this way can be made to imprint upon owners, leading to a trend of keeping them as unusual pets.</p>\n<p>While not magical in nature, vulture talons are traditionally used as charms in healing and removing disease, stemming from an old belief that the raptors were immune to the filth in which they strode.

Due to their size, giant vulture talons in particular are sometimes used to craft weapons in regions where other resources are scarce。</p>",

They are playful and kind, and while they have a long tradition of assisting spellcasters, they prefer to be treated as equals and partners rather than pets. They're quite intelligent and don't appreciate condescension from those who treat them as simple animals.</p>\n<p>Tiny dragons have appeared in tales told among traditional Varisian communities for centuries, but only relatively recently have they become known by the name \"house drake.\" This new name arose in the city of Korvosa, where house drakes have adapted particularly well to urban life. When students of the magic school called the Acadamae failed in their studies and allowed their imp familiars to run wild, these tiny dragons found that they were particularly well suited to combating them. Most notably, their teeth become striated with silver due to their peculiar grooming habits, allowing their bites to puncture the imps' magically resistant skin. The two species are well-matched in intellect. Though their clashes typically begin with trying to outwit one another, they often end in messy brawls across rooftops and into alleys. The residents of Korvosa appreciated both the protection and the dragons' charming appearance and demeanor. House drakes are now more common in Korvosa than anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<p>House drakes are carnivorous, eating vermin and small birds. Though they're capable of hunting for food, many of them find it a bit dull and prefer to spend their time at other pursuits. They happily accept donations of food. To truly get on a house drake's good side, though, one should offer a gift of silver. Donations to drakes have become regular practice in Korvosa, to the point where \"Paid any drakes lately?\" has become a common phrase to suggest someone is a bit gullible and soft-hearted. These donations are just that-charity. House drakes avoid taking on anything resembling a \"job,\" taking pride in their self-sufficiency and ability to choose for themselves how to spend their time。</p>",

Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p>\n<p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant few trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat.</p>\n<p>Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength.

Kangaroos also occasionally rock back on their tails before delivering a blow with their heavily muscled hind legs. The claws on their back legs make these blows particularly deadly, and a kangaroo can disembowel an attacker with a single strike using this tactic.</p>\n<p>Like other marsupials, female kangaroos carry their young-called joeys-in a pouch on their bellies. They have only one such offspring at a time, although many females have several joeys in quick succession. These social animals largely gather for protection, but their social structures are similar to those found in herds of camels, horses, or pigs.</p>\n<p>Kangaroos don't make particularly good mounts, but this hasn't stopped the occasional adventurous gnome or halfling from trying. Such an attempt usually results in a seasick and dizzy rider being dumped unceremoniously from the animal's back or pouch, but some druids have found them to be loyal companions.</p>\n<p>In places where kangaroos are common, the animals are sometimes hunted for meat and can even provide a primary food supply to migratory communities due to their quick reproduction and ability to flee predators.

Kappas also enjoy proving their worth in competitions of strength and, despite their propensity for trickery, are known to be honorable competitors who keep their word and remain polite in conversation.</p>\n<p>While kappas vary in physical attributes from region to region, they're all amphibious, turtle-like humanoids with beaked mouths, webbed hands and feet, and slimy scales that range in color from bluish green to pale yellow. They often have black hair, arranged in a ring to accommodate the central depression atop a kappa's head. Water from a kappa's home lake, stream, or river fills these depressions, or head bowls, which are believed to be the source of their strength. Younger kappa are easily tricked into bowing and accidentally emptying the water out of their own head bowls. Losing this water makes the kappa lethargic. The longer a kappa's head bowl remains empty, the weaker they grow. While this issue rarely poses a serious danger for a kappa living near their home body of water, it can prove fatal to a more adventurous kappa.</p>\n<p>Kappas aren't inherently hostile and have been known to befriend lonely children and lend aid to stranded adventurers by providing directions or minor medical treatment. Still, many areas known to house kappas have signs both warning of the creatures' presence and encouraging travelers venturing over or through water to first toss in a cucumber, kappas' favorite food, in exchange for safe passage. Kappas put up some of these signs themselves to increase the likelihood of receiving a tasty treat。</p>",

Kitsune revel in joy and beauty, often practicing storytelling, dance, and other creative arts. However, they also have a penchant for playing pranks on the joyless and self-important, earning them a reputation as tricksters. Favored by the goddess Daikitsu, kitsune seem to be almost supernaturally lucky, perpetually dodging danger by the narrowest margins.</p>\n<p>While kitsune settlements do exist, most kitsune are incredibly curious and often leave home at a young age to encounter new people and sights. Some kitsune spend years in their tailless form, living disguised among humanoids in urban or rural societies whose inhabitants have no clue of their true nature. Others go to the opposite extreme, spending most of their lives in the form of a fox, only to reveal themselves at the most opportune moment. For many kitsune, revealing their true form to someone is a sign of great trust, but it's also not uncommon for kitsune to display their dual nature openly.</p>\n<p>Kitsune's connection to the spiritual world grants them a number of magical abilities. Aside from their innate shapeshifting powers, kitsune naturally develop more potent magic as they mature, and they seem to effortlessly pick up skills that would rival the most practiced spellcasters.

His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born-Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds.</p>\n<p>To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year.</p>\n<p>Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches.

A ledalusca can see a vampire, for example, but is unable to reproduce its image. For a creature that effectively has an unlimited memory for images, this proves utterly confusing. The vague memory of the encounter sticks in the ledalusca's mind like a splintering a humanoid's finger。</p>",

They're majestic, territorial, and extremely grumpy-traits that make them dangerous to unwary travelers and would-be predators alike. Males are instantly recognizable, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with large heads and thick necks to support their impressive palmate antlers. They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate.</p>\n<p>For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual.</p>\n<p>A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground. This can make them easy to track, though hunters will find actually killing a moose is a far greater challenge than finding it. Despite their size, moose have many natural predators, especially pack animals like wolves and large carnivores like tigers. Large humanoids like ogres and trolls dwelling in the wilderness sometimes make sport of chasing down and wrestling moose.</p>\n<p>Despite their large size, moose are expert swimmers in both fresh and salt water, and they readily feed on aquatic vegetation. Moose rarely swim into open seas, however, and usually stay close to land, though ocean predators have been known to hunt swimming moose. To an observer watching from the safe distance of a dry shore, the large branching antlers of a swimming moose can sometimes be mistaken for a tree bobbing along in the water。</p>",

Their bodies are covered in tightly layered scales that range in color from green to brown, and almost all nagaji have a colorful ridge along their head and back. Ophidian eyes lend nagaji an imperious visage, with irises that span every color of the rainbow.</p>\n<p>Nagaji physiology varies somewhat. Some possess vestigial tails, while others have sharp claws, and some even sport impressive fangs that can inject a simple venom. Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and reproduce by laying eggs; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely. They're a hardy and strong people, but their close ties to nagas mean many have the potential for powerful magic, as well.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the naga goddess Nalinivati created the first nagaji as the backbone of a society that respected nagas. But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions when a matriarch overstepped her bounds to support a new naga's claims of rulership. Nagaji accurately note that their long history with nagas is no simple matter and claim that the partnership goes both ways: nagas rely as much on nagaji for the running of their empires as nagaji rely on nagas to lead their people to prosperity.</p>\n<p>Although nagaji might be encountered in diverse cities and urban centers, their communities are concentrated in environments that suit their biology, namely jungles and tropical forests. Where many species would languish in the heat and humidity, nagaji bask in the warmth and thrive。</p>",

They take particular delight in exploiting the greed and hubris of gullible worshippers, using them to desecrate and destroy their own faith. Even in their goal of undermining the holy, nikaramsas' twisted humor knows few bounds, and they prefer to take on the guise of divine messengers with boons to share. Once they find a likely victim or set of victims, they use their vast knowledge of religion to impart contradictory wisdom, leading to the eventual implosion of the faith from heresies of the clergy and congregation themselves.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Asuras are, above all, proof that the gods are not infallible. These fiends arose as physical manifestations of divine accidents, taking form when the gods themselves stumbled and blasphemed on a cosmic scale. As a result of their own divine genesis, an asura loves above all to undo the workings of the divine. They eagerly travel to the Material Plane, seeking out temples, congregations of faithful worshippers, and religious orders of all stripes to sow doubt and destroy what the gods seek to build。</p>",

Though they're prevalent as a symbol, often scrawled across the margins of alchemical tomes, few know that the beasts actually exist in the Astral Plane, where they fly through the silvery-gray void like a serpentine wheel. The ouroboros is usually depicted as a snake devouring its tail. This circular symbol is synonymous with infinity, self-sufficiency, and eternal unity.</p>\n<p>An ouroboros' form exemplifies the unfathomable concepts of forever. Its undulating body is composed of smaller serpents, who are in turn composed of ever smaller serpents, continuing indefinitely. These smaller components are recycled as the ouroboros devours its tail, existing in a perpetual, cyclical process of creation and destruction. It is a massive creature, forming a loop roughly 50 feet in diameter and weighing hundreds of tons.</p>\n<p>An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound.

Agathions are born from the souls of mortals who attained the enlightenment they sought in life, sometimes even after death. Because they all start out as mortals who were rewarded for their determination, self-awareness, and purity of heart, agathions are more likely than other celestials to intervene in working nonviolently against the spread of evil on the material plane. Agathions have served as moderators between the chaotic azatas and lawful archons, so they know how vital communication with mortals can be to bridge differences and ensure that evil doesn't win out.</p>\n<p>All agathions possess animal-like aspects, some appear more anthropomorphic, while others spend most of their time in forms nearly indistinguishable from true animals. Still others prefer to shapeshift as they see fit, or present as humanoid when in the company of humanoid mortals.</p>\n<p>Each type of agathion serves a specific role in Nirvana. Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment. Since agathions receive their animal forms as rewards for their mortal lives, they take great insult with insinuations that they're merely magical talking beasts or-even worse-that their forms are a curse or punishment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As the most whimsical and playful of the agathions, procyals are the most likely to be encountered on the Material Plane, teaching deep philosophical lessons and delivering wisdom through pranks and impersonations.

Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.</p>\n<p>Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson.

Others posit they were once a cult of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator.

A mortal who shows a shae their due deference is worth keeping around, so many shae collect cults of personality or expansive entourages.

Landowners delight in having shikigami protect their gardens, whether they paid a wandering spellcaster to entreat the shikigami or simply had the fortune of another spirit assigning a shikigami to their land. Travelers who come across a shikigami-graced milestone or waypost believe that such encounters are good omens for the journey ahead.</p>\n<p>For their part, shikigami have mixed opinions on civilization and the humanoids who dwell therein. While shikigami will fight to protect their ward against invaders and desecrators, these kami are just as likely to leave-their ward in tow-if locals begin to despoil the area or show a disregard for nature. Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving an uncomfortable vacuum with their unexpected exodus.

He usually targets people with the audacity to question his position or teachings, but also relentlessly harasses anyone he envies.</p>\n<p>Shrine skelms are skilled listeners, especially in settings like group prayers where they can learn worshippers' fears or hopes. They exploit whatever information they learn for their own prestige and power, but they also watch for jealousy and the seeds of rage that could be nurtured to make a new skelm. They can even intercept sincere prayers and steal their effects for themselves, and they command several spells to manipulate and control their unwitting, vulnerable victims.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls.

Agathions are born from the souls of mortals who attained the enlightenment they sought in life, sometimes even after death. Because they all start out as mortals who were rewarded for their determination, self-awareness, and purity of heart, agathions are more likely than other celestials to intervene in working nonviolently against the spread of evil on the material plane. Agathions have served as moderators between the chaotic azatas and lawful archons, so they know how vital communication with mortals can be to bridge differences and ensure that evil doesn't win out.</p>\n<p>All agathions possess animal-like aspects, some appear more anthropomorphic, while others spend most of their time in forms nearly indistinguishable from true animals. Still others prefer to shapeshift as they see fit, or present as humanoid when in the company of humanoid mortals.</p>\n<p>Each type of agathion serves a specific role in Nirvana. Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment. Since agathions receive their animal forms as rewards for their mortal lives, they take great insult with insinuations that they're merely magical talking beasts or-even worse-that their forms are a curse or punishment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Silvanshees are a stealthy and extremely inquisitive contingent of agathions who gather information about the mortal world for other agathions. While they love to explore the Material Plane and sate their curiosity, they're generally reclusive and skittish. These dual instincts war with each other whenever something exciting piques their interest. Because of their small sizes, they don't pose a combat threat to most creatures; instead, silvanshees act as Nirvana's eyes and ears in the mortal world, reporting back to superiors or calling for help should they run into danger.</p>\n<p>Silvanshees appear indistinguishable from domestic felines, save for their violet eyes and the telltale blaze of differently colored fur on their chests. Of course, flying gives them away outright, so if at all possible, they only do so while in trusted company to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>Their fur color runs the spectrum of normal feline colorations.

Their soft, dappled brown fur helps them hide in forest canopies, and they have shimmering insectile wings and big eyes that draw in the faintest beams of light. At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however.</p>\n<p>Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity-hence its name-before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to domesticate the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect。</p>",

A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century.

Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than</p>\n<p>a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.</p>\n<p>All sthenos descend from a single woman of the same name. Stheno rebelled against the poisoned gift of nightmares that the goddess Lamashtu granted her sisters, the powerful medusa matriarchs known as euryales. Stheno prayed to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, for help in overcoming her twisted birthright. Eventually, Lamashtu's power struck Stheno down, but Stheno's remaining faith and will imbued each of the hundred snakes from her hair with a mind and will of its own. Each snake grew into an individual stheno, and a new ancestry was born that day.</p>\n<p>Sthenos have been slowly spreading across the land, their numbers growing as they can have children with humans. In these families, children of all genders are born either fully human or fully stheno, seemingly at random. Sthenos with a welcoming community to call home tend toward large families with many children, perhaps from some survival instinct as early members of a new ancestry.</p>\n<p>Sthenos, unsurprisingly, have a great love for snakes, and they tend to keep other snakes as pets and companions to their hair. Stheno hair snakes are non-venomous and love to eat insects within their reach. They are semi-autonomous, though their behaviors are colored by the stheno's emotions. An angry stheno might find their snakes lashing out at the subject of their wrath, while an amorous stheno's snakes might just want to snuggle instead。</p>",

Despite their still developing abilities, they eagerly hone their skills with make-believe missions. Many hope that they'll one day become responsible guardians like their parents.</p>\n<p>Smaller in stature and ferocity, stone lion cubs sometimes try to guard places of smaller importance, often including facsimiles of the same kinds of structures their parents attend. They're less than dependable as guardians, as they have the attention span and rambunctious nature of children. Their parents often need to call them to heel, ordering them to stay at the parent's side as parent and child both stay motionless for the rising day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Stone statues of beasts can often be found paired and standing guard to either side of an entryway. While some seem like merely lifeless statues, others are far more than they appear to be. Guardian beasts ward against evil and misfortune. Some of these celestial spirits were assigned this task, while others assumed their roles out of a sense of duty. To allow them to maintain a constant presence in the material world, pious artisans carve stone vessels of the beasts in their likeness; these statues then serve as anchors for the guardian beasts' souls. Should the need arise, guardian beasts can merge with their stony form, becoming a dangerous foe with noble courage, an indomitable will, and few weaknesses.</p>\n<p>By day, guardian beasts stay in their vessels and pretend to be inanimate. Past nightfall, they might patrol the grounds in their stone form or leave the heavy vessel behind to go where a solid body can't reach. Some take this chance to visit the dreams of individuals they favor and send them messages, notifying them of strange occurrences or warning them of incoming danger. Despite their</p>\n<p>good intentions, the dream messages from guardian beasts can be obscure, often overshadowed by the spirit's personality or strange assumptions they make due to their nature as resolute guardians.</p>\n<p>While guardian beasts can work alone, they usually appear in bonded pairs who complement each other in nature. One could be a jokester, the other gloomy; another could be nurturing, the other strict. To make two otherwise identical-looking beasts distinct, sculptors often depict one stone animal with their young. In the case of stone lions, a common type of guardian beasts, this approach means carving stone lion cubs to accompany one of the guardians。</p>",

While not malicious, neither are they empathetic to the plight of their victims. They would sooner forget about those whom they have played tricks on and leave them to die than lead them back to their intended path through guilty altruism.</p>\n<p>A tikbalang's occult magic stems from the esoteric mystery of believing the lie. In the moment of crafting illusions or conjuring extradimensional spaces, the tikbalang themself believes that what they are creating is real. This makes their spells harder to resist, and this same principle also makes them very effective liars. But this readiness to believe also makes them susceptible to deceptions and illusions in turn, and they are particularly vulnerable to mind games. Lone travelers without magic of their own often learn riddles, sleight of hand, or other tricks to defend against a tikbalang's oft-deadly entertainment. Other whispers suggest wearing one's shirt inside-out to confuse the creatures, or passing by a tikbalang's forest quietly to avoid drawing their attention.</p>\n<p>Unlike most illusionists, tikbalangs can also rely on their physical prowess should the need arise. They have unusually long legs that end in cloven hooves, and they stand as tall as ogres when upright. Skilled climbers and leapers, they are also well known for being master wrestlers, where their long limbs put them at a distinct advantage over their foes.

These troubled souls, the tales say, rise at the next sunset as tormented undead, doomed to forever search for the road they lost in life. Always wandering, the trailgaunt treads the ground over and over until its legs wear down to bloodied stumps. Even then, it staggers on, groaning in constant pain. Consumed with agony and a hatred for travelers of all kinds, they prey on those who-like they once did-stray from their path.</p>\n<p>Lacking feet, a trailgaunt is slow but largely impervious to obstacles in its path, shambling at an equal pace through boggy mires, thick brambles, and desert sands. Yet, these horrors come to a halt at the edge of any well-maintained road, which are the only barriers to their endless wanderings, since they can't willingly tread upon the roads that betrayed them.</p>\n<p>Because so much of Varisian culture centers around travel, trailgaunts often turn up in their legends. Most depictions of trailgaunts include Varisian clothing, tattoos, or jewelry, but these undead arise around the world, each bearing the trappings of the cultures they lost. Further north, along the Crown of the World, trailgaunts wail amid howling winds, shivering as they shamble through the snow.</p>\n<p>Along Garund's Golden Road, trailgaunts are common sights in the trackless desert wastes, where even an experienced traveler can easily lose their way. To the south, travelers lost in the Mwangi Expanse who starve before being eaten themselves become damp, mossy trailgaunts.</p>\n<p>While most travelers who hear a trailgaunt's wail know to run fast and far, some adventurers intentionally seek out these undead. Few trailgaunts perish with no belongings at all, and many poor souls doomed to this fate were once merchants or adventurers who carried substantial wealth and magical treasure-some of which still might be on their person. It never occurs to these treasure seekers that in their pursuit of such riches they might become trailgaunts themselves。</p>",

Functionally immortal but built for vengeance a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire clan or settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. There are many stories where a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation.

These stories are encountered more often than their subject, however. A reclusive people, umasi live deep in remote jungles, largely isolated from other societies.</p>\n<p>Despite not being undead, umasi can't heal naturally or via magic. Instead, they must harvest appendages and organs from the living to perpetuate their own lives. These modifications require special techniques, obscure rituals, and often the assistance of other umasi. Shorter rituals make quick repairs to wounded flesh-even consuming a nutrient-rich organ of a recently slain creature can provide quick rejuvenation-while more extensive changes require a full day's work.</p>\n<p>Because of the nature of their existences, no one single form remains common to umasi. Many graft any number of arms or legs of various sizes on their bodies, while others are conglomerations of exotic beasts, other humanoids, and whatever creatures they've hunted or scavenged. However, all umasi remain vaguely humanoid in shape. An umasi with additional arms can hold or wield more items at once, while additional legs or other limbs might grant increased Speed or new types of Speed. Concepts such as gender, ethnicity, and even recognizing someone based on their appearance are irrelevant to umasi. Instead, they value age and experience and identify themselves with iconic adornments or speech patterns.</p>\n<p>Despite their morbid nature, umasi are rarely at odds with living creatures. These opportunistic hunters value their self-preservation, but use fast‑acting nonlethal poisons to subdue their targets for safe and minimally destructive harvesting. Few umasi harbor malice toward the living, but some possess a streak of self-loathing and search for powerful magics that might break whatever curse binds them to their current state. Rarely, an umasi finds some strange form of acceptance on the fringes of a remote community where their skills at medicine carry more weight than fear of their strange appearances。</p>",

Devotion to monastic training and magical study has led to secondary populations forming in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray, eastern Katapesh, and northeastern Nex.

Mostly, these stories are just fictions of fearful minds, but it's true that wayangs were originally creatures of shadow, straddling the edge between light and darkness. The ancestors of modern day wayangs set out on a great exodus some 10,000 years ago, leaving their native Shadow Plane to seek out a new home. On Golarion, they found a great cataclysm had blocked out the sun behind a cloud of smoke and ash, enshrouding the planet in a seemingly endless night, and here they made their new home. When the light returned, wayangs retreated into what shadowy places they could find, avoiding contact with humans and other peoples of the light, who viewed the small, gaunt beings as suspicious reminders of difficult times.</p>\n<p>Many wayang groups are nomadic, though many other groups have sedentary communities. Some live in homes carved out of natural caves, where they create works of art from stalagmites and other natural features. Others live in treetop villages in rain forests where sunlight barely penetrates the thick canopy of the forest. Wayangs are most populous in southeastern Tian Xia, especially in the archipelago of Minata, also known as the Wandering Isles, but their travels can sometimes take them to even further lands.</p>\n<p>Despite their sinister reputation and secretive nature, wayangs are joyous creatures who tell stories and express their emotions through whisper-singing, dancing, and shadow puppetry, enhancing their performances with shadow magic. Similarly, they weave shadow magic into their deadly fighting styles, but wayangs are not a violent people, usually fighting only to protect what's theirs. Wayangs decorate their stringy hair with beads and their dusky skin with tattooed white dots that form pictures, with each picture silently telling stories about their family's history or their worship of various deities of shadow。</p>",

Their eight legs give them sure footing even in icy terrain, and they grow thick, warm fleece as protection against the elements.</p>\n<p>Arctic ranchers have been breeding wollipeds for hundreds of years, as the gentle creatures take well to domestication and make plentiful, hardy sources of meat, milk, and wool. The creatures also provide sure-footed transport in difficult mountain regions, and they can even be trained for plowing and hauling if necessary.</p>\n<p>As a result of their widespread domestication, few are found in the wild. Young wollipeds have weak vision during their first few weeks and habitually follow any larger creature that walks by. Usually, these young wollipeds become attached their rancher or parents, but on occasion a few might follow large wild creatures and wander off from their herd. This has led to feral wollipeds around the Kodar mountains in Irrisen that are much more aggressive than their domesticated cousins.</p>\n<p>Wollipeds are extremely sturdy, and their docile temperaments make them excellent mounts for those traveling mountain passes. Some mountain settlements have further trained their wollipeds to fight. Battle-ready wollipeds are formidable enemies that pose a threat to even the most experienced of challengers-but even untrained, wollipeds are not defenseless. In addition to their long tusks, they have developed spitting as a way of communication and assault, and readily regurgitate a mixture of stomach acid and the remnants of their last meal to deter predators.</p>\n<p>Few on Golarion realize that these arctic beasts are not native to their world. Wollipeds originated on the planet Triaxus, a world with a magically enhanced eccentric orbit around the same star as Golarion. During the centuries-long Triaxian winters, wollipeds play an integral role in many communities as food, wool, transportation, and even a simple form of companionship. During the equally extended tropical summers, wollipeds retreat to the polar extremes of their world to await the return of the long snows。</p>",

Regardless of personal agenda, wyrwoods prioritize the survival of their people above all else, even to the detriment of others when necessary.</p>\n<p>Despite gaining their freedom, wyrwoods struggle to establish a home in Avistan. Some Avistani still view wyrwoods as tools of a secretive cabal, while others consider them traitorous servants who turned on their creators. Fearing for their safety, many wyrwoods fled the Inner Sea region to create a new home in Arcadia. In the coastal city of Segada, wyrwoods live in relative peace and safety, but they still prefer insular lifestyles.</p>\n<p>Given their extreme self-reliance, wyrwoods have learned a degree of adaptability that far surpasses that of other cultures. When a wyrwood community finds itself in need of a specific skill or function, a member of the community-either a volunteer or one selected communally-takes it upon themself to learn the required abilities. They don't view any task as lesser or demeaning, as hubris is foreign to a wyrwood's construct nature.</p>\n<p>A wyrwood's soul is tied to the magical stone that serves as their heart, which sometimes survives even when their construct body perishes.

They most notably feature a pungent stench caused by bodily secretions building up within their thick, shaggy pelts-a stench so strong that yzobu herds can often be smelled before they appear. Territorial and aggressive, yzobus often attack other creatures on sight. When threatened, a herd launches into a stampede, trampling any in their path and goring survivors with their distinctive horns.</p>\n<p>Some ranchers trade yzobu hides as a workable leather for mercenaries and guards, but the powerful smell means that most ranchers tend their small herds on the outskirts of towns. Typically, yzobus aren't raised to a specific age, but rather are killed whenever one escapes and poses a threat. The hides require an intensive tanning process with almost constant brushing and hours soaking in salt water-but the effort results in a leather both soft to the touch and sturdy enough to work as an effective armor for several years.</p>\n<p>Hides aren't the only yzobu products worth harvesting. A female yzobu's milk is rich and nutrient-rich, making it a staple food source in some regions. Their meat is less enticing but still edible.</p>\n<p>These beasts remain a permanent part of hobgoblin society, where their aggressive temperaments and durable, sturdy bodies are great assets. Hobgoblins possess an immunity to yzobu stench, and they view the fact that other races sickened by it as further evidence of their own superiority. They also highly prize yzobu mounts, and hobgoblin commanders often paint their yzobu's horns in varying colors and patterns to show how many enemies the mount has killed. Yzobu cavalry are a staple of hobgoblin military action, and they played a key role in the recent Ironfang Invasion that led to the formation of the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak in Avistan. The establishment of Oprak meant that many Avistani who had never encountered yzobus before have grown familiar-if not enchanted-with their distinctive odor。</p>",
