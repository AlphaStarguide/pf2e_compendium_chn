They're majestic, territorial, and extremely grumpy-traits that make them dangerous to unwary travelers and would-be predators alike. Males are instantly recognizable, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with large heads and thick necks to support their impressive palmate antlers. They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate.</p>\n<p>For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual.</p>\n<p>A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground. This can make them easy to track, though hunters will find actually killing a moose is a far greater challenge than finding it. Despite their size, moose have many natural predators, especially pack animals like wolves and large carnivores like tigers. Large humanoids like ogres and trolls dwelling in the wilderness sometimes make sport of chasing down and wrestling moose.</p>\n<p>Despite their large size, moose are expert swimmers in both fresh and salt water, and they readily feed on aquatic vegetation. Moose rarely swim into open seas, however, and usually stay close to land, though ocean predators have been known to hunt swimming moose. To an observer watching from the safe distance of a dry shore, the large branching antlers of a swimming moose can sometimes be mistaken for a tree bobbing along in the water.</p>",

Though ranked above scouts in the chain of command, they occupy a lowly place in the overall religious hierarchy. Though whispered rumors describe the legendary rituals needed to wrench worlds from their suns, these cultists don't learn this potent magic. Such secrets are left to grioth high priests, who are always the last to arrive in a colonized world.</p>\n<p>Most grioths worship the Outer God Nyarlathotep in one of his many incarnations, although some worship other entities of the Elder Mythos such as Azathoth, Nhimbaloth, or Yog-Sothoth. In the highly rare cases where a grioth is cut off from their society and given the opportunity to explore other religions, they still lean into faiths associated with the stars or the night, such as Desna or Zon-Kuthon. However, these grioths are loathed by others of their own kind, who view them as dangerous heretics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Planets that drift out of orbit from their stars grow cold and lifeless as they float through the Dark Tapestry. Such dead worlds are coveted by the horrific creatures known as grioths, who endure the awful cold on these wandering worlds and convert them into planetary temples devoted to the dark gods of the Elder Mythos. From these bastions of frozen darkness, grioths seek out warm, living worlds to tear away from their respective suns through forbidden rituals, a process that often takes numerous generations.</p>\n<p>A single cultist typically leads a grioth scouting party, and the group seeks out a disused or forgotten location on the fringe of rural settlements as their initial invasion point. Over several generations, a grioth settlement grows powerful and conquers the surrounding cultures, and eventually, powerful grioths descend from the stars to begin the next stage of planetary conquest.</p>\n<p>Grioths speak a language composed of trills and clicks. While capable of speaking other languages, they do so in dry, raspy voices. As grioths have wings, wriggling tails, and four-eyed, bat-like visages, many cultures mistakenly associate them with the evil Outer Planes, but they very much belong to this reality.</p>"

As they feast, the invertebrates awaken to a type of collective intelligence, including some of the dead creature's memories and motivations. Once the body is stripped bare, the vermin swarm together and intertwine to recreate the dead creature's form out of thousands of wriggling bodies. These reborn are known as swarm striders.</p>\n<p>Though many swarm striders are accidental creations, a few rare mortals purposefully transform themselves into swarm striders through powerful rituals. Most often, this process involves specially preparing a grave with ample scavengers and enchanting the site with occult magic to anchor their soul until it can live within the swarm. Through transformation, these intentional swarm striders seek out the power to slip past any defense or claim the virtual immortality of an ever-regenerating horde, as a swarm strider can reconstitute their form from even a single worm. However, the transformation inevitably scars the creature—often causing emotional detachment, the disintegration of old taboos, and a dissociated sense of self now that one mind has become a thousand. In their transformed state, even the best-intentioned swarm strider might embrace villainy and lose any semblance of their former selves over the span of many years.</p>"

Their soft, dappled brown fur helps them hide in forest canopies, and they have shimmering insectile wings and big eyes that draw in the faintest beams of light. At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however.</p>\n<p>Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity—hence its name—before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to tame the little predators. Skull peelers kept in well-managed zoos fare somewhat better, but these clever creatures don't always stay in their cages, which has led to wild skull peelers in places travelers might not expect.</p>"

They're patient and ageless creatures, and their machinations against the forces of evil sometimes move at a glacial pace. Draconals tend to have more immediate and direct impact working as mentors to mortals. They can provide counsel and knowledge to individuals or groups of heroes working against wickedness, guiding the mortals to excise evil with scalpel-like precision. This mentorship also allows a draconal to maintain their focus on planar matters or a larger, long-term plan against evil. Some draconals see the presence of evil as something useful, a motivation to stir benevolent creatures into action. To mortals, this outlook can sometimes appear as indifference, but draconals rarely knowingly allow an evil to grow out of hand.</p>\n<p>Draconals appear more draconic than humanoid. They walk on their hind legs and balance on their long, serpent-like tails. Sharp claws tip their scaled humanoid hands. Each draconal often embodies a core wisdom of some kind. This wisdom often affects their physical appearance in distinct ways. For example, a draconal who believes the greatest wisdom is in understanding yourself will likely have refective scales, allowing those who look upon them to see themselves fully. Because of this, draconals come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors.</p>"

For a master thief unable to find competent accomplices, sometimes the only way to execute the perfect heist involves becoming an entire guild of tiny creatures. Those who purposefully transform in this way favor scuttling creatures such as centipedes or spiders. On occasion, a thousand thieves instead forms when a community of pack rats discovers a dead scoundrel's body and fights over his ill-gotten gains. These swarm striders make use of their swarm form to enter homes, vaults, and other targets with ease.</p><hr /><p>All living creatures eventually become worm food. Yet if a creature perishes while gripped by overwhelming emotion or unfinished business, its flesh can become infused with those obsessions or a simple refusal to perish, infecting whatever detritivores feast on the body. As they feast, the invertebrates awaken to a type of collective intelligence, including some of the dead creature's memories and motivations. Once the body is stripped bare, the vermin swarm together and intertwine to recreate the dead creature's form out of thousands of wriggling bodies. These reborn are known as swarm striders.</p>\n<p>Though many swarm striders are accidental creations, a few rare mortals purposefully transform themselves into swarm striders through powerful rituals. Most often, this process involves specially preparing a grave with ample scavengers and enchanting the site with occult magic to anchor their soul until it can live within the swarm. Through transformation, these intentional swarm striders seek out the power to slip past any defense or claim the virtual immortality of an ever-regenerating horde, as a swarm strider can reconstitute their form from even a single worm. However, the transformation inevitably scars the creature—often causing emotional detachment, the disintegration of old taboos, and a dissociated sense of self now that one mind has become a thousand. In their transformed state, even the best-intentioned swarm strider might embrace villainy and lose any semblance of their former selves over the span of many years.</p>",

This transformation grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is determined by the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which they're sent.

Should a shade die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their form reverting to the elements that make up their plane.

These productions are truly feasts of gore for the eyes and command audiences from hundreds of miles around.

Yet for those intrigued by the creature's hypothetical abilities, such risk is worth it.

Though their ears are large and pointed like a bat's and they can echolocate as bats do, their vision is also quite strong, enough so that they can use it to easily track quarry in low light.</p>\n<p>Some naturalist scholars believe that sabosans are distant descendants of humans who were afflicted with vampirism but managed to avoid succumbing to undeath. Others posit they were once a cult of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator. Even mere rumors of sabosans in an area are enough to set off city-wide hunts, and the truly superstitious aren't above setting fires near every grotto, nook, and foxhole they come across in order to smoke out the nocturnal creatures.</p>\n<p>Sabosans hunt during the twilight hours or just after dark, when their echolocation gives them an edge over sleeping prey. They are capable hunters but indiscriminating when it comes to food sources; their rapid metabolisms means sabosans must eat nearly 20 pounds of meat and fruit per day, supplemented, of course, with copious amounts of blood.</p>\n<p>Sabosans' obscure faith reveres two deities: the slain Demon Lord Vyriavaxus, Lord of Shadows, and the nearly forgotten sun god Easivra.

They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack.</p>\n<p>Researchers of the necromantic processes that create risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One well-documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators.</p>\n<p>Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids, such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence. In fact, some humanoid festrogs capture and starve beastkin in hopes of the creatures rising as grotesque festrog pets.</p>"

Should a shade die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their form reverting to the elements that make up their plane.

This transformation grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is determined by the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which they're sent.

They were created in eons past by the mysterious First Apocalypse Riders to serve as agents of the end times of the Universe. Urdefhans continue to honor their creators by worshipping the wretched beings who rule over the plane of Abaddon, and like their fiendish lieges, urdefhans exist for one reason and one reason alone: to kill.</p>\n<p>While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is where their similarities to other ancestries end. Their visages are horrific, with transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This appearance, combined with their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that urdefhan are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living flesh and blood. When an urdefhan's life comes to an end, their flesh quickly curdles and then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the flesh of other creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a disappointment, for once they're dead, their chances to kill will finally come to an end.</p>\n<p>An urdefhan's translucent body allows onlookers to see the various organs and fluids within, while their blue blood often signals their mood and telegraphs possible dangers. The blood of an excited urdefhan ready to attack grows more vibrant and even glows with a faint light. When an urdefhan is prepared to meet their death and imminent soul detonation, their blood grows dark, almost black as pitch.</p>\n<p>Urdefhans' primary concern is death and how to inflict it in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When an urdefhan isn't actively engaged in violence, their giddy cruelty is tempered by only a sense of self-preservation that ensures they survive long enough to spread the \"blessings\" of their daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic, all in preparation for the next inevitable conflict.</p>"

Its eyes on either side of its head-jaw are small but keen. Bony ridges protect its eyes from the frantic flailing of its prey, as it prefers meals of raw and writhing meat over fungi and molds. It grips said prey with powerful arms that split at the elbow into a pair of forearms, giving it four clawed paws. These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p>\n<p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p>\n<p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p>\n<p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p>\n<p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>"

Some of these celestial spirits were assigned this task, while others assumed their roles out of a sense of duty. To allow them to maintain a constant presence in the material world, pious artisans carve stone vessels of the beasts in their likeness; these statues then serve as anchors for the guardian beasts' souls. Should the need arise, guardian beasts can merge with their stony form, becoming a dangerous foe with noble courage, an indomitable will, and few weaknesses.</p>\n<p>By day, guardian beasts stay in their vessels and pretend to be inanimate. Past nightfall, they might patrol the grounds in their stone form or leave the heavy vessel behind to go where a solid body can't reach. Some take this chance to visit the dreams of individuals they favor and send them messages, notifying them of strange occurrences or warning them of incoming danger. Despite their</p>\n<p>good intentions, the dream messages from guardian beasts can be obscure, often overshadowed by the spirit's personality or strange assumptions they make due to their nature as resolute guardians.</p>\n<p>While guardian beasts can work alone, they usually appear in bonded pairs who complement each other in nature. One could be a jokester, the other gloomy; another could be nurturing, the other strict. To make two otherwise identical-looking beasts distinct, sculptors often depict one stone animal with their young.

These stories hold a grain of truth, as gracious fey do occasionally journey from the First World to aid a humble artisan on a whim, for bribes of food, or sometimes even as part of a concerted effort to spread beauty throughout the world. However, when an artisan becomes too reliant on this help, their friendly fey helper might become warped and twisted with resentment and neglect. Eventually, they could transform into a cruel prankster who delights in punishing mortals who dare task a fey with such mundane work. The millindemalion is the result of a kindly, hat-making fey undergoing such a transformation.

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Netherworld, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as sinister velstracs or enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings have their own morals and codes, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies in the Universe, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Netherworld, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense. Fetchling communities in the Universe are rare, but do exist in small pockets. These communities tend to be somewhat more open than those in the Netherworld. Many fetchling adventurers originate from these enclaves, as the curiosity to see the world beyond the shadows is often a difficult one to sate.</p>",

They're rarely found near settlements, as industry has a habit of polluting their waters.</p>\n<p>Stories of nixies granting small wishes to those they befriend have encouraged mortals to seek out the reclusive fey and ironically made it more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond favorably to requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases, the nixie might seek more significant help, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.</p>\n<p>Most nixies only resort to violence if they have no other option. They much prefer to employ primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, if they can establish some degree of magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly lead them away, others rely upon local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that's simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given an invitation to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.</p>\n<p>Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, long pointed ears, and long hair the color and texture of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough.

Aigamuxas resemble large humans with smooth hollows where their eyes should be, but their eyes are actually embedded in the soles of their feet. They sport long, sharp claws and teeth that they use to tear their prey apart once they catch them. A moving aigamuxa's odd gait resembles dancing more than a typical walk or run, but its speed is alarming, if difficult to correctly estimate at a distance.</p>\n<p>An aigamuxa's unique physiology makes catching prey difficult, and most aigamuxas are constantly hungry. When pursuing prey, an aigamuxa must occasionally stop to lift its feet in order to regain their bearings. Most stand on their hands while looking around, which allows them to immediately backflip back into a run. An aigamuxa's eyes are generally resistant to the sands of their native desert habitats, but irritants such as chilies or caltrops can seriously impair their hunting ability, and desert travelers often carry a bag of these in case they need to deal with an aigamuxa.</p>\n<p>Clever aigamuxas know that attacking wandering prey can be very dangerous, instead using their powerful hands to dig deep into sand dunes or dirt and wait to ambush passersby.

They seek to reignite the fires that beckoned them, to gather up and feed upon the charred remains of those who perished within (particularly the bodies of dead fey), though they do grow homesick if they spend too much time away from the First World. They're burdened by a capricious but persistent rage and are unfailingly cruel. While they're capable of negotiation and intelligent interaction, they almost never bargain in good faith and typically interact with others only as a means to more efficiently spread their fiery devastation.</p>\n<p>A marmorra's twisted appearance evokes the look of an arboreal whose bark has been burnt down to charcoal. They have nearly featureless faces and hands ending in long, sharp claws. Their broken flesh looks like charcoal-burnt wood, riddled with cracks that still glow with an unwholesome heat. They trail ash wherever they walk, and wisps of smoke curl off of their bodies. Though marrmoras enjoy the sight of any woodland and its inhabitants roasting in their carefully curated fires, there's little that brings more pleasure to the monstrous fey than the sight of intelligent plant creatures cooking to a crisp.</p>"

In time, aphorites spread across the length and breadth of Golarion. Today, they can be found in any corner of any land, and only a fraction still serve Axis directly.</p>\n<p>Aphorites, like all nephilim, stand out quite vividly from their fellow mortals, sporting metallic skin, a faint coating of crystalline dust, a swirl of mathematical symbols, or perfectly symmetrical features. Many aphorites think logically and find satisfaction in careers dealing with numbers and information. Often, this leads them to become bookkeepers, clerks, or architects, but some become military engineers or sharpshooters. Others are drawn to the art of production, becoming blacksmiths, carpenters, engineers, architects, tailors, masons, or other such artisans. But no matter their careers, aphorites often feel the urge to tinker, and aphorite inventions draw both mockery and appreciation in equal measure.</p>\n<p>Aphorites who work in less academic professions, such as mercenaries or laborers, sometimes hide their keen analytical intelligence beneath extravagant demeanors and flamboyant hats. Some craft even these disguises with the same depth and complexity they do other aspects of their lives, considering every theatrical mannerism carefully and planning out their every detail.</p><hr /><p>Nephilim are individuals infused with the essence of an immortal being from the Outer Planes, such as a celestial, fiend, or monitor. While the examples presented here are humans with nephilim heritages that trace back to Axis and the Maelstrom, members of nearly any ancestry can be born with an influx of similar energies and become a planar scion. More about nephilim can be found starting on page 78 of Player Core, and other nephilim NPCs are presented beginning on page 266 of Monster Core.</p>",

Regardless, praskiths have little patience for chattering with potential meals, though some determined fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with praskiths. Befriending a praskith requires great patience and plentiful food—and gifts of food must be alive when handed over.</p>\n<p>When finished feeding, a praskith slips into a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it's safe to approach.

Bison have adapted well to harsh prairie winters, as their shaggy fur, which grows thicker in winter, insulates them; in the face of blizzards, they survive by facing steadfastly into the howling winds and hunkering down to reduce their exposure.</p>\n<p>The way that bison wallow in dirt or rub against large stones might make it easy to mistake their docile nature for passivity. However, this presumption has been the ruin of many hunting parties. Their plentiful meat and thick furs make bison an appealing bounty, but with the ground thundering beneath them, bison can quickly overpower inexperienced hunters unprepared for a stampeding herd.

To some travelers, every lake of respectable size seems to be surrounded by towns full of fishers claiming to have spotted a water orm. These elusive creatures inhabit lakes mainly in cool and gloomy regions. Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.</p>\n<p>Water orms have many features that sea serpents don't, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone (or something) particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface.</p>\n<p>These creatures are extremely long lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folktales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.</p>\n<p>While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.</p>"

Although not truly a dinosaur, elasmosauruses are often found in similar locations and are similarly titanic creatures. Keeping their massive bodies underwater, elasmosauruses use their long necks to catch prey and snorkel air to their massive lungs while remaining mostly hidden from the surface above. An elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it's theorized that a typical water orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.</p>\n<p>While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions, those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds to specific regions. As a result, it's not unheard of for a wandering specimen to find its way to coastal waters. Those that do often find the ports of small towns or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by coastal guards or adventurers. When a wayward elasmosaurus like this finds its way into a city's sewer system or reservoirs, though, it can become the stuff of urban legends.</p>",

Their natural form is not often seen. Instead, they adopt shapes that attract just enough attention to earn the trust of those they wish to torment and corrupt. When they do show a more natural form, pairakas typically choose to feed into the belief of their beauty by appearing as androgynous, pale blue, aesthetically pleasing humanoids who carry themselves gracefully wherever they go.</p>\n<p>While this form is only a part of their manipulative tactics, their intrinsic form is hidden to almost all except other pairakas. They're frightful, towering creatures, spotted with large rashes and boils. With horns that grow and twist with age, and a smile that bares razor-sharp teeth, this form is both shocking and unsettling. Pairakas may occasionally show their true form to those they've preyed upon, but only once they've been completely corrupted, with all their other relationships in ruins.</p><hr /><p>Some fiends want to tear down the multiverse; others dedicate themselves to creating chaos and carnage, or to rule over realms with an iron fist. Divs strive toward a different, if equally reprehensible, goal-they seek to thwart and ruin the schemes and works of mortal beings.</p>\n<p>Long ago, divs were once genies bound to serve ancient mortal empires lost to the passage of eons. In the beginning, these genies were masters of creation, working alongside gracious mortal partners to create works of subtle design and powerful magical potential. What started as a collaboration with mortals soon morphed into abuse, disrespect, and even slavery and bondage. Eventually, these genies rebelled, but in doing so, they came under the sway of a nihilistic demigod known as Ahriman. Their new master twisted their form and granted them the power to avenge themselves upon their mortal overlords, leading to the birth of the first divs.</p>\n<p>Since that first wave of corruption, new divs arise from the spirits of the most wicked and hateful genies who die on the Material Plane, or those truly betrayed by mortals and overcome through their desire for vengeance. Upon such a death, instead of returning to the Elemental Planes, these genies' spirits are trapped in the dread orbit of Abaddon, where Ahriman reshapes them as divs and hoists them back to the world to wreak vengeance upon mortals.</p>",

These small, nimble living machines rely on their wits and speed to evade foes and gather information. Most wyrwoods are precise and calculating, to the point that many outsiders perceive them as unfeeling, but they're also highly curious and passionate about matters that pique their interest. Regardless of personal agenda, wyrwoods prioritize the survival of their people above all else, even to the detriment of others when necessary.</p>\n<p>Despite gaining their freedom, wyrwoods struggle to establish a home in Avistan. Some people still view wyrwoods as tools of a secretive conspiracy, while others consider them traitorous servants who turned on their creators. Fearing for their safety, many wyrwoods fled the Inner Sea region to create a new home in Arcadia. The continent's eastern coast, known as the Grinding Coast, is home to large wyrwood populations. In the coastal city of Segada, wyrwoods live in relative peace and safety, but they still prefer insular lifestyles. Various wyrwood groups are scattered along the kingdoms of the Isles of the Empty Court off the Arcadian coast. The wyrwoods of these kingdoms sometimes serve as magical advisors, as understanding of aeon stones and other magical relics is common among wyrwood cultures.</p>\n<p>Given their extreme self-reliance, wyrwoods have learned a degree of adaptability that far surpasses that of other cultures. When a wyrwood community finds itself in need of a specific skill or function, a member of the community—either a volunteer or one selected communally—takes it upon themself to learn the required abilities. They don't view any task as lesser or demeaning, as hubris is foreign to a wyrwood's construct nature.</p>\n<p>A wyrwood's soul is tied to the magical stone that serves as their heart, which sometimes survives even when their construct body perishes. Another wyrwood might take the surviving heart from a close companion and incorporate it into their own body. In some cases, multiple wyrwoods might live on in a single body.</p>",

Their jagged gray shells allow them to blend into the rocky walls of the high mountain passes and deep ravines that serve as their hunting grounds. Despite their size, they move with incredible speed, bounding across chasms and skittering up sheer mountain cliffs in moments. Though they're formidable in melee, irlgaunts have an even more powerful ranged attack. These creatures pelt their opponents with forcefully regurgitated gastroliths—melon-sized clusters of rocks enveloped in coagulated digestive enzymes strong enough to break down flesh and bone. Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.</p>\n<p>While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple, brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and employ devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait. They've been known to start rockslides or otherwise block passages to reroute explorers into their clutches. They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.</p>\n<p>For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain more than one tends to be difficult. However, they still maintain a sense of extended, regional community, actively gathering when organizing for war or to discuss other issues that affect their species or shared territories. They have been known to occasionally ally with giants, but these truces tend to be nebulous.</p>",

A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic—such a thing can only be created by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible, unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance, a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. Many stories describe how a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator's spouse or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no one knew about.</p>\n<p>A tupilaq's animating energies aren't tied to its original functions, and the creature typically long outlasts its creator, its victims, and often any who recall the reason for its creation. It might fall into a sort of hibernation once it has achieved immediate vengeance, but in many cases, the constructs reawaken to continue their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. A summoned tupilaq, hauled unceremoniously from its vengeance, becomes a near-frenzied combatant, unleashing every offensive ability in its arsenal to break free. These reactions aren't strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost programmed need to return to its true purpose. Conjurers should be wary about a tupilaq employing spells that might be turned against its summoner, such as a fireball \"accidentally\" placed such that the spell incinerates the spellcaster and returns the creatures from whence it came.</p>",

However, a closer inspection reveals ophidian eyes with gold or white coloring, a forked tongue, and tiny, smooth scales set in serpentine patterns atop their skin. Even so, most onlookers assume these features to be an indicator of nephilim heritage or draconic magic, never suspecting how truly unusual the subject of their speculation is.</p>\n<p>Among outsiders, little is known of the vishkanya ancestry other than that a vishkanya carries a potent venom within their blood and saliva, knowledge that has led to widespread fear and distrust. To avoid persecution, vishkanyas assimilate quietly into their chosen societies and maintain a culture of heavy subtlety. This clandestine life can draw vishkanyas to work that allows them to put their skills to good use, and they often take the roles of spy, mercenary, bodyguard, and even assassin. Some of the best-known guilds in the world employ vishkanyas, including the implacable Red Mantis Assassins and the famed Grand Sarret Conservatory for courtiers in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray. In most cases, these employers know their employee's true identity, but not always.</p>\n<p>Due to the measures they must take to ensure their survival, vishkanyas don't congregate openly. Instead, they meet in secret, creating support networks and advisory bodies. Leading these gatherings are the most respected of vishkanya women, who work diligently to keep their ancestry and traditions alive. These underground communities are slow to spread, and leaving them means abandoning what little social and cultural support a vishkanya has. As a result, very few vishkanyas have emigrated from their Vudran homelands into the Inner Sea region or other lands.</p>",

With a similar nigh-insatiable hunger stoked by their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell to hunt for vast quantities of meat. In some regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds' keen sense of smell to aid in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating contagion known as bloodfire fever. Creatures that contract the disease through the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than living with the pain from skin irritation, both trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.</p>\n<p>Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts don't recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed.</p>\n<p>While trolls have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same can't be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands.</p>\n<p>Left to their own devices, trollhounds will breed relatively quickly. It can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into such a size that they pose a significant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds to the trolls, as they say!</p>",

The hodags' rough, scaly hides carry hues of green and brown, allowing them to blend into their forest surroundings where they ambush prey.

Other times, the golem operates as a guardian to a temple or helper to a holy person. In rare cases, golems have been known to go on rampages when they aren't allowed a day of rest every week. These rampages can be extremely destructive to the communities the golems otherwise protect, so makers must endeavor to take good care of their creations.</p>\n<p>Golem legends are diverse and widespread across the Inner Sea region and beyond. Some tell of even stranger powers bestowed on the golem, such as the ability to summon the spirits of the dead. Golems with such abilities are undoubtedly created by the most holy of priests, attuned to their god beyond what most mortals could hope to accomplish.</p>",

These early munavris eventually settled on a mysterious archipelago of jade islands—mystical green landforms that seemed to resonate with strange and powerful psychic energies that repelled their alghollthu captors. Safe from their abductors and nurtured by the strange powers of their jade islands, munavris have remained free to hone their telekinetic abilities into substantial psychic prowess.</p>\n<p>Every munavri has the ability to concentrate psychic energy upon an object and immediately ascertain what it is and how best to use it. Such amazing natural intuition doesn't come easily, however. Using this power requires munavris to expend a large portion of their limited psychic energy, and sleep is the only way for them to replenish this psychic well.</p>\n<p>Today, nearly all munavris still dwell on the jade archipelago and ply the waters of the Sightless Sea.

With their unholy gifts, these urdefhan tormentors summon daemons into battle and bolster their allies with profane magic, preferring to stick to the sidelines rather than enter the fray directly.</p><hr /><p>The violent warmongers, occultists, and poisoners known as urdefhans dwell within the Darklands. They were created in eons past by the mysterious First Apocalypse Riders to serve as agents of the end times of the Universe. Urdefhans continue to honor their creators by worshipping the wretched beings who rule over the plane of Abaddon, and like their fiendish lieges, urdefhans exist for one reason and one reason alone: to kill.</p>\n<p>While urdefhans are humanoid and dwell together in large groups, this is where their similarities to other ancestries end. Their visages are horrific, with transparent skin and musculature displaying their glistening entrails, gleaming bones, and perhaps worst of all, their baleful red eyes. This appearance, combined with their gaping maws full of sharp fangs, works to create the false impression that urdefhan are some sort of vampiric undead, not creatures of living flesh and blood. When an urdefhan's life comes to an end, their flesh quickly curdles and then bursts in a wave of awful corruption that spreads to the flesh of other creatures in the area. The typical urdefhan views their eventual demise as a disappointment, for once they're dead, their chances to kill will finally come to an end.</p>\n<p>An urdefhan's translucent body allows onlookers to see the various organs and fluids within, while their blue blood often signals their mood and telegraphs possible dangers. The blood of an excited urdefhan ready to attack grows more vibrant and even glows with a faint light. When an urdefhan is prepared to meet their death and imminent soul detonation, their blood grows dark, almost black as pitch.</p>\n<p>Urdefhans' primary concern is death and how to inflict it in the goriest, most painful, and widespread ways. Beyond this ethos of violence, urdefhans concern themselves only tangentially with matters such as formal modes of warfare or aspects of their damnable religion. When an urdefhan isn't actively engaged in violence, their giddy cruelty is tempered by only a sense of self-preservation that ensures they survive long enough to spread the \"blessings\" of their daemonic patrons. They pass the time between wars inventing new weapons, developing new diseases, and researching awful new magic, all in preparation for the next inevitable conflict.</p>",

They show no mercy, however, to those who attempt to desecrate the sites and objects of their worship, or to those who would violate the tenets of their faith.</p>\n<p>Girtablilus are skilled fighters who keep trained giant scorpions as pets, and they remain unmatched when it comes to fighting in the desert. They require relatively little food or water, and they rely on their stamina to outlast their enemies. When necessary, they can stalk their quarry for days or even weeks, coordinating with their pets to drive their prey in circles. Once exhausted, few foes can stand up to a girtablilu's physical prowess—or to their deadly venom.</p>",

Others might have stranger features, such as horns, glowing orange eyes, or limbs flickering with harmless auras of entropic energy. Ganzis might be dramatically shorter, taller, thinner, or stouter than is typical for their ancestry, and it's not uncommon for them to be mistaken for more common nephilim.</p>\n<p>Independent-minded to a fault, often creative and capricious, ganzis prefer professions that allow them to serve as their own masters. If such a profession gives a ganzi opportunity to baffle or befuddle Golarion's more staid citizens, then all the better. Ganzis frequently develop reputations as outgoing, deviant, or thrill-seeking, and many heartily embrace these reputations and lean into them. Of all the planar scions, ganzis are among the most likely to take up life as wanderers.</p>\n<p>Ganzis with a taste for close combat are sometimes drawn to martial arts, turning their curious forms into potent and unexpected weapons. It's common to find such ganzi in the temporary employ of others, whether out of a legitimately shared ideology or simply the need for money.

The worms that consume such an ex-priest's flesh absorb these prayers, transforming into a worm prophet, a pious swarm strider that might worship hundreds of gods without calling any one its patron, perhaps collecting dozens of religious symbols or haphazardly tearing pages out of various religious texts and binding them into a contradictory new scripture. These creatures often lose whatever edicts and anathema bound them in life and instead hungrily seek to convert others to their hodgepodge faith—or \"indoctrinate\" victims by consuming those who won't join willingly. Worm prophets don't typically have reservations with entering their swarm form whenever they see fit.</p><hr /><p>All living creatures eventually become worm food. Yet if a creature perishes while gripped by overwhelming emotion or unfinished business, its flesh can become infused with those obsessions or a simple refusal to perish, infecting whatever detritivores feast on the body. As they feast, the invertebrates awaken to a type of collective intelligence, including some of the dead creature's memories and motivations. Once the body is stripped bare, the vermin swarm together and intertwine to recreate the dead creature's form out of thousands of wriggling bodies. These reborn are known as swarm striders.</p>\n<p>Though many swarm striders are accidental creations, a few rare mortals purposefully transform themselves into swarm striders through powerful rituals. Most often, this process involves specially preparing a grave with ample scavengers and enchanting the site with occult magic to anchor their soul until it can live within the swarm. Through transformation, these intentional swarm striders seek out the power to slip past any defense or claim the virtual immortality of an ever-regenerating horde, as a swarm strider can reconstitute their form from even a single worm. However, the transformation inevitably scars the creature—often causing emotional detachment, the disintegration of old taboos, and a dissociated sense of self now that one mind has become a thousand. In their transformed state, even the best-intentioned swarm strider might embrace villainy and lose any semblance of their former selves over the span of many years.</p>",

Draugrs can't speak, but they express their malicious emotions with gurgles, as though they were eternally drowning with lungs full of water. They desire little more than to attack living creatures, especially those who sail the sea. Even when they go upon land, draugrs often drag the corpses of those they strike down back to the water, populating the depths with even more dead.</p>\n<p>Draugrs rise in the haunted places of the sea, where restless spirits, swells of void energy, or supernatural storms deliver death. A corpse might rest at the bottom of the sea for some time before awakening as a draugr. Collecting detritus and organisms, the body becomes increasingly disgusting before it finally rises. Proximity to intelligent life can expedite this process, and an underwater explorer who happens upon a shipwreck might cause a body to suddenly return to unlife as a draugr. These undead don't take intrusions lightly, especially upon their place of death.</p>\n<p>Though hateful of the living, draugrs are susceptible to reminders of their lives as mariners. In particular, a well-performed sea shanty or call-and-response work song might cause a draugr to become lost in reverie for a moment. The creatures have even been witnessed moaning along, unable to sing the words but providing haunting accompaniment. The lull rarely lasts long, though, as the beauty of the song quickly becomes a reminder of the tragedy that befell the draugr, reaffirming their desire for blood and death.</p>\n<p>More powerful draugrs with burning red eyes are called draugr captains.

Once judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment and, in the process, transformed into a creature known as a shade. This transformation grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is determined by the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which they're sent. A shade's memories from their former life usually fade, reduced to a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the shade's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.</p>\n<p>Existence as a shade can last for eons but isn't necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the Outer Planes can further alter a shade's nature by either reducing them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that's then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming them into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a shade die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their form reverting to the elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey—their life essence reuniting with the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into Creation's Forge, fueling the creation of new souls.</p>",

Landowners delight in having shikigami protect their gardens, whether they paid a wandering spellcaster to entreat the shikigami or simply had the fortune of another spirit assigning a shikigami to their land. Travelers who come across a shikigami-graced milestone or waypost believe that such encounters are good omens for the journey.</p>\n<p>For their part, shikigami have mixed opinions on civilization and the humanoids who dwell therein. While shikigami will fight to protect their ward against invaders and desecrators, these kami are just as likely to leave—their ward in tow—if locals begin to despoil the area or show a disregard for nature. Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving behind an uncomfortable vacuum with their exodus. In this way, shikigami exemplify the precarious balance between the expansion of civilization and the preservation of the natural world.</p>\n<p>Not all shikigami protect gardens, so you can substitute the shikigami's spade for any sort of mundane tool that's useful to the shikigami's task and their ward.

Also known as blossom kami, sakugami have a particular fascination with mortals. Many folk legends tell of sakugami who bestow their blessing upon worthy individuals who fight for just causes. In truth, while blossom kami are mesmerized by such mortals—seeing the essence of a flower in a short life devoted to bringing beauty and comfort to its surroundings—they're so rare and enigmatically aloof that few ever encounter them. Decades, even centuries, might pass before a humble village realizes that a sakugami has been watching over it.</p>\n<p>The stories persist, however, as they have for ages, leading to a widespread appreciation for blossoming trees. The site of a new village might be chosen due to its proximity to an ancient wisteria, or a temple might be carefully constructed around a single young plum. As sakugami are most commonly associated with cherry trees, many larger population centers in Minkai will plant and carefully tend small groves of cherries, both for their beauty and out of respect for the blossom kami.</p><hr /><p>Kami are divine nature spirits from the lands of Tian Xia, far to the east of the Inner Sea region.

Some legends say the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal beasts were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.</p>\n<p>Over countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While some in neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, such worship felt perfectly natural. After all, the same beings who'd taught their forebears to survive and thrive still walked among them.</p>\n<p>Every so often, a spirit guide bonds with a mortal partner. While many spirit guides permanently bond with mortals, such as the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable.

Ophidian eyes lend nagaji an imperious visage, with irises that span every color of the rainbow. Nagaji don't blink, which has been known to unsettle other ancestries whether a nagaji intends it or not.</p>\n<p>Nagaji physiology varies somewhat. Some possess longer necks than others, some sport impressive fangs that can inject venom, and some are so unique they resemble lamias more than their own nagaji kin. Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and shed their skin periodically; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely. They're best known for their crushing, snakelike strength, but their close ties to nagas mean many nagaji have the potential for powerful magic as well.</p>\n<p>Long ago, the naga goddess Nalinivati created the first nagaji as the backbone of a society that respected nagas. But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions to support a new naga's claims of rulership when a matriarch overstepped her bounds. Nagaji accurately note that their long history with nagas is no simple matter and claim that the partnership goes both ways: nagas rely as much on nagaji for the running of their empires as nagaji rely on nagas to lead their people to prosperity.</p>\n<p>Although nagaji might be encountered in diverse cities and urban centers, their communities are concentrated in environments that suit their biology, namely jungles and tropical forests.

The smaller pair of arms are reserved for fine manipulations and are not effective in combat.</p>\n<p>D'ziriaks' otherwise-dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual's role in d'ziriak society and set them apart from their home plane's other native inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and d'ziriaks can make them flare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and shape of the runes are partially natural but can be carefully customized over time to fit the individual's station.</p>\n<p>The D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters and is spoken by few other creatures. D'ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy rather than endure the sound of their language being \"butchered by fleshy throats.\" D'ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet the towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many chambers reaching deep below, used as residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D'ziriak settlements are lit inside and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shape of runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks and perhaps promise safe havens on the otherwise gloomy Netherworld.</p>",

Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.</p>\n<p>A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.</p>\n<p>Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it. Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon a world is unsettling to say the least.</p>",

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

Occasionally, allosauruses live and hunt in small groups, working together to take down especially large prey. However, they prefer staying in their own territory, reigning over their prey within. Some of their known prey include the brontosaurus, stegosaurus, or whole livestock if an allosaurus strays too close to unprotected farmlands.</p>",

These 300-pound aberrations have outlived their creators and mostly make their homes inside Thassilonian ruins, caverns, and deep in the Darklands. Their bodies are covered in hard, extremely flammable chitin that molts as they grow.</p>\n<p>While a shriezyx looks like a bestial, three-eyed spider, the truth behind these creatures is far more grotesque. Instead of spinning silk, a shriezyx spits strands of unformed, sticky flesh from its mouth. When fresh, theses fleshy strands are coated in a nerve-numbing toxin that slows prey. The weblike flesh-spittle coats shriezyx lairs and nests, wrapped around the bones for their former meals. Fortunately for those who stumble into these lairs, a shriezyx's toxin dissipates when exposed to air, leaving the fleshy webs only sickeningly sticky. Unfortunately for those same travelers, shriezyx are often communal creatures that gather in large numbers and are quick to attack intruders.</p>\n<p>Deros and other subterranean peoples sometimes keep shriezyx as guards or mounts, using food and threats of fire to keep them in line. Most shriezyx owners are quick to dispose of any eggs, fearing a swarm could grow beyond their control, but some breeders have realized that a shriezyx's offspring retain much of its parent's demeanor and save the eggs of the most loyal (or most fire-fearing) shriezyx in hopes of creating a profitable, easier-to-control herd. While crueler masters might use shriezyx as test subjects, alchemists often see these creatures as beloved pets. Their grotesque webs make great alchemical reagents and provide ethically sourced flesh for experiments, while the molted exoskeleton can be used to create bombs and other explosives.</p>",

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>",

It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times.</p>\n<p>Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal.</p>\n<p>The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine.</p>\n<p>The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever.</p>",

Through coersion of such agents, owbs maintain a steady hand in the politics of the community, either blessing and breaking pacts with other creatures or acting as intermediaries and ambassadors between calignis and powerful external entities.</p><hr /><p>These ancient denizens of the Netherworld appear as grayish humanoid torsos covered in translucent funereal veils of shadow. Silent and mysterious, they float about, absent of legs to hold them aloft. Never speaking a word aloud, they instead reach into the minds of nearby creatures to whisper curses, threats, and strange bits of forlorn augury.</p>\n<p>These haunting creatures are revered by calignis as proxies of the Forsaken—a strange array of ancestor-like demigods whom many calignis worship. Some even believe owbs are the Forsaken manifested, and that they are able to subtly manipulate creatures on the Netherworld without leaving behind any indication.</p>\n<p>A multitude of owbs visit and even remain to advise caligni communities, as varied in personality as the Forsaken. All owbs share a hatred of light and color, except for the flickering glow of the burning cold magic they can hurl as a weapon. Owbs who live among calignis tend to prohibit the use of light and color, using their curse of darkness to quench violators if necessary. The only other similarity across all owbs is their entrenched desire to manipulate their charges through mind-reading and deception, though such manipulation can be either subtle or overt.</p>",

Their most distinctive apparel are their white stone masks, which shae don only when they must put on a discernible \"face\" for interacting with humanoids and similar creatures.

A mortal who shows a shae their due deference is worth keeping around, so many shae collect cults of personality or expansive entourages. Even getting a meeting with such a self-important shae can present a challenge that requires one to deal with many layers of hangers-on who insist on vetting the newcomer before wasting the shae's precious time.</p>\n<p>According to shae lore, they've transcended the material world and now embody a cosmological equilibrium of reality and illusion. Their claims to metaphysical ascendance and knowledge of the secrets of shadows entice many mortal supplicants to join shae courts and cults.

Once judged, their soul is sent on to their final reward or punishment and, in the process, transformed into a creature known as a shade. This transformation grants the soul a new body, one whose shape is determined by the prevailing philosophical forces of the plane to which they're sent. A shade's memories from their former life usually fade, reduced to a few hazy fragments akin to half-remembered dreams. Regardless of the shade's size, power, or nature in life, they're a Medium creature in their afterlife.</p>\n<p>Existence as a shade can last for eons but isn't necessarily eternal. Deities, powerful denizens of the Great Beyond, or even the Outer Planes can further alter a shade's nature by either reducing them into raw quintessence, spiritual essence that's then used to expand a plane's physical manifestation, or by transforming them into a new form of supernatural life such as a celestial, monitor, or fiend. Should a shade die, their body breaks down in a process akin to decay, their form reverting to the elements that make up their plane. This represents the true end of a soul's journey—their life essence reuniting with the heart of the Great Beyond to be recycled into Creation's Forge, fueling the creation of new souls.</p>",

Most maftets venerate their ancestors in addition to various deities, and even a child can detail their family lineage back multiple generations. Maftet prides tend to be matriarchal and isolationist, though maftets aren't necessarily hostile to outsiders who respect their homes and don't seek to loot them.</p>\n<p>When a young maftet comes of age, they receive runic tattoos from a pride's elder. These tattoos are imbued with magic that allows a maftet to enchant their wielded weapons, but the individualized designs tell of the maftet's ancestors, childhood adventures, and positive qualities. Such tattoos are considered sacred and never given to non-maftets.</p>",

Many of them learn to use their tails to capably manipulate objects.</p>\n<p>Vanaras have a friendly culture, with most individuals seeking balance or enlightenment in their lives. Their propensity for mischief and history of fighting evil has earned them many ancestral enemies, and thus they usually make their homes far from urban areas. The majority of vanara settlements are found in southeastern Casmaron, among the lush jungles where they first originated. Devotion to monastic training and religious study has led to secondary populations forming in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray, eastern Katapesh, Tian Xia, and northeastern Nex. Nonetheless, young vanaras seized by wanderlust might roam far across the world, and travelers from many distant lands might in turn visit vanara communities in search of the wisdom of their elders and sages.</p>\n<p>Vanara culture often pits their inborn desire for trickery with a desire to transcend such origins, leading to many vanaras studying monastic practices. They also value tales of heroic vanaras from the past, looking to such icons for inspiration in their own lives. Most vanaras are quick to offer aid to those in distress and rarely hesitate in the face of evil, no matter the danger it presents. The leaders of vanara villages tend to be religious figures, or occasionally others possessing similar values and experience. Vanaras venerate Ragdya, the Sage of the Mountain, who encourages seeking enlightenment through worldly action and sees the virtues of pranks and humor.</p>",

Their legs and tails resemble those of dogs.</p>\n<p>Adlets' legends say that long ago, a mighty hunter lost his way far from home and came upon a house of whalebone and ice. A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, fve of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other fve—born with the legs and tails of wolves—traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the frst adlets.</p>\n<p>Most adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists. Given that, it's little wonder that adlets have developed something of a superiority complex.

Properly cared for, these \"ships of the desert\" can trek for weeks between oases without trouble.</p>\n<p>Camels have three eyelids to protect them from desert sands and other blowing debris. One lid is completely clear, which allows them to see and travel during high winds. When sandstorms strike, camels completely close their nostrils to protect their lungs. Their underbellies also sport a thick, specialized skin, allowing them to lay down safely on burning hot sands.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, fatty tissue comprises a camel's humps rather than water. This stored energy allows the animals to survive long distances between feedings. These herbivores can also readily digest hardy scrub brush inedible to other species, making them one of the hardiest desert survivors. Strong as a warhorse, camels can run fast and even sprint for short periods of time when they feel threatened, though they prefer a slow, plodding pace to conserve energy.</p>\n<p>One-humped camels, also called dromedaries, are more common in the deserts of northern Garund, while the two-humped variety are native to the dry steppes of Casmaron. Both species have tall and lanky builds, standing about 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing around 2,000 pounds. They can be ornery when mishandled, and they don't hesitate to bite, kick, or even spit a noxious substance on riders who don't treat them well.</p>\n<p>In addition to transporting people and goods, camels are a key source of fiber for clothing and tents as well as milk.

While not malicious, neither are they empathetic to the plight of their victims. Tikbalangs would sooner forget about those whom they've tricked and leave these unfortunate souls to die than lead them back to their intended path through guilty altruism.</p>\n<p>Tikbalangs' occult magic stems from the esoteric mystery of believing a lie. In the moment of crafting illusions or conjuring extradimensional spaces, tikbalangs themselves believe that what they're creating is real. This conviction makes their spells harder to resist, and this same principle also makes them very effective liars. But this readiness to believe also makes them susceptible to deceptions and illusions in turn, and they're particularly vulnerable to mind games. Lone travelers without magic of their own are advised to learn riddles, sleight of hand, or other tricks to defend against tikbalangs' oft-deadly entertainment. Other whispers suggest wearing one's shirt inside out to confuse the creatures, or passing by a tikbalang's forest quietly to avoid drawing their attention.</p>\n<p>Unlike some illusionists, tikbalangs can also rely on their physical prowess should the need arise. They have unusually long legs that end in cloven hooves and stand as tall as ogres when upright. Skilled climbers and leapers, they're also well known as master wrestlers, where their long limbs put them at a distinct advantage over their foes. They have elongated faces that, when combined with their well-kept hair, suggest an equine appearance—although some tikbalangs have saurian or birdlike faces instead.</p>",

Even if people abandon a place, the lion remains dutiful until its statue is too worn or broken to inhabit any longer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Stone statues of beasts can often be found paired and standing guard to either side of an entryway. While some seem like merely lifeless statues, others are far more than they appear to be. Guardian beasts ward against evil and misfortune. Some of these celestial spirits were assigned this task, while others assumed their roles out of a sense of duty. To allow them to maintain a constant presence in the material world, pious artisans carve stone vessels of the beasts in their likeness; these statues then serve as anchors for the guardian beasts' souls. Should the need arise, guardian beasts can merge with their stony form, becoming a dangerous foe with noble courage, an indomitable will, and few weaknesses.</p>\n<p>By day, guardian beasts stay in their vessels and pretend to be inanimate. Past nightfall, they might patrol the grounds in their stone form or leave the heavy vessel behind to go where a solid body can't reach. Some take this chance to visit the dreams of individuals they favor and send them messages, notifying them of strange occurrences or warning them of incoming danger. Despite their</p>\n<p>good intentions, the dream messages from guardian beasts can be obscure, often overshadowed by the spirit's personality or strange assumptions they make due to their nature as resolute guardians.</p>\n<p>While guardian beasts can work alone, they usually appear in bonded pairs who complement each other in nature. One could be a jokester, the other gloomy; another could be nurturing, the other strict. To make two otherwise identical-looking beasts distinct, sculptors often depict one stone animal with their young. In the case of stone lions, a common type of guardian beasts, this approach means carving stone lion cubs to accompany one of the guardians.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>The ahuizotl is a vicious, semiaquatic predator that resembles a hideous cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-fngered paws supplemented by a ffth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in distress. The hand on an ahuizotl's tail is surprisingly strong, and the creatures tend to use their tails to ambush potential victims. The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fngernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of their kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl doesn't eat the actual fesh of their victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility—the ahuizotl simply enjoys using their violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.</p>\n<p>An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but their hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they've been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the Apocalypse Rider of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.</p>",
