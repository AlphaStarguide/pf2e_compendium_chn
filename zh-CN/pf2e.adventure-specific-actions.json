The hero gains a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and saving throws against the villain until the start of your next turn. If you Spin a Tale on your next turn, the story continues for another round, for a maximum of 10 rounds. While the tale continues, minor, crude illusions spring into being in your space; these are arcane illusion effects that have no mechanical impact other than illustrating your tale.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.feat-effects.UzIamWcEJTOjwfoA]{Effect: Spin Tale}</p>"

You Study twice, each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the next time you take the Study downtime activity, you're particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at a @Check[type:flat|dc:8] check or be @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} for that day.</p>"
