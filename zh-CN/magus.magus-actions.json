You create a thread of magic between yourself and the required enemy, tethering them by a puppet string made from the lingering magic of your spell. This puppet string is broken if a creature spends an Interact action to break it or you and the tethered creature are further than 30 feet from each other. While tethered, your target takes a –1 status penalty to their Will saves against your spells with the required traits and they gain weakness 1 to mental damage from your spells.
