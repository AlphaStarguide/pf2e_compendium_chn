Its ability to follow orders is granted by the otherwise mindless humanoid brain that floats in its dome-like head. In exceptionally rare cases, the brain used in its creation might retain fragments of memories or even actual intellect, resulting in an alchemical golem with a personality and agenda of its own.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

These monsters, stripped of personal will or desire, are born into the service of an evil god whom they worship unerringly and untiringly, often in spite of any opposing religious leanings they may have had in life. Every herecite harbors an unquenchable self-hatred because it was defiled by such a foul resurrection-a rage it turns outward in an attempt to rob others of their faith and lives.</p>\n<p>Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal. While cabal members share enhanced magic and defenses, induction into a cabal appears to hold even deeper significance for herecites. The presence of others of their kind with whom they can pray-in verses warped to venerate wicked gods-seems the only solace these tormented beings can find in undeath. Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late.</p>\n<p>Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators-often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished-may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life. Whether motivated by a desire for contrition or vengeance, the end result of this baleful pilgrimage is always the desecration of the holy site and the slaughter of its congregants, who may in turn rise as lesser forms of undead.</p>",

They live in simple familial communities, battling rival groups and other aggressive Darklands inhabitants in order to survive. They occasionally raid surface settlements, usually at the behest of cruel, bloodthirsty leaders who are often themselves in the thrall of more powerful creatures like nagas or demons. A typical xulgath has dull gray, dark gray, or ashen scales, with a long tail and bony protrusions that run the length of its spine. A typical xulgath is 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</p>\n<p>Although today the xulgaths are brutal and scattered, they were one of the first intelligent humanoids to rise in the primeval world, once ruling over a mighty empire that stretched throughout the Darklands. Today, all that remains of this era are ruins of massive stone ziggurats and crumbling cities found within some of the larger caverns. Some groups of xulgaths continue to live among these ruins, venerating their ancestors' accomplishments, while others consider these areas taboo and leave them to become infested with Darklands vermin. Sages don't agree on why the ancient xulgath civilization fell. Some suspect it was the result of a loss of several wars waged against serpentfolk, while others suggest that the corruptive influence of demon worship rotted their culture from within.</p>\n<p>Certainly, many xulgath settlements continue to worship demons to this day, paying homage and offering live sacrifices to terrible creatures from the Abyss. Occasionally, a xulgath shaman can call forth and bind a lesser demon to help serve the group, but a shaman who delves too deep into occultism might summon a more powerful fiend that either tears the xulgaths to pieces or enslaves them.</p>",

Circus owners who mistreat their animals through harsh discipline or overtraining see little wrong with their mercilessness, even going so far as to slaughter their entertainers-supposedly \"by accident\"-via neglect or abuse. The victims of such cruelty who cannot move onto the afterlife-either because they somehow become infused with negative energy or their spirits cannot rest without first enacting revenge on their assailants-occasionally rise from the dead as visitants.</p>\n<p>These undead monsters haunt the sites of their demise and search out the masters who made their lives so hellish with only one goal in mind: vengeance. When they can't locate their particular abuser, or if they are still unable to rest even after confronting their aggressor, visitants seek out similarly evil harmers of animals, becoming torturers of torturers. However, visitants are for the most part unable to distinguish between individual members of a species; thus, if a visitant was abused by a human trainer, any human that crosses its path may become a target of its rage.</p>\n<p>A visitant resembles a zombified animal, but it retains a spark of the animal intelligence it had in life, making it all the more dangerous as a result. Visitants' bodies are marred by the horrors of their brutal existences: Their mouths are furrowed in a constant snarl, with a black ichor dripping from their cracked, rotten lips.

Some speculate that the more kind-hearted the elf (and the more wrenching the betrayal), the crueler the banshee.</p>\n<p>Banshees rarely stray far from where they perished and typically haunt thick forests and canopied swamps where little light graces the ground. Many banshees can be found in the elven nation of Kyonin, specifically in Tanglebriar, the sinister domain of the demon Treerazer. Similarly, a large number of banshees can be found lurking about the edges of drow settlements in the Darklands, as plenty of cruelty and betrayal exists in drow culture.</p>\n<p>Banshees' mere touch inflicts pain and primal fear, and those exposed to their wails of grief rarely survive the experience.</p>",

			"name": "Obsidian Golem",
			"publicNotes": "<p>The art of golem animation is not limited to societies with access to expensive crafting materials or a long history of arcane mastery. Among the resource-poor xulgaths who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection-magically warping and working normally inflexible stone-and the end result is an obsidian golem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

			"name": "Qormintur",
			"publicNotes": "<p>When Qormintur was just 10 years old, her family decided to sell their business in a small duergar settlement and look for new opportunities in the Darklands city of Hagegraf. A few days after departing, duergar slavers attacked their caravan, murdered her father, and captured everyone else. Qormintur was sold as a slave in Shraen, and she never found out where her mother or siblings were taken. She did discover, however, that one of her father's business rivals had blackmailed her parents to leave, and the same duergar had arranged for the slavers to attack the caravan. The memories of that betrayal and the loss of her family still haunt her, and her deepest desire is to get her revenge.</p>\n<p>When she arrived in Shraen, Qormintur was first taken to the city's slave pens to be sold as a laborer, personal attendant, or fodder for one of Shraen's undead nobles. Despite the hopelessness, fear, and anxiety she witnessed in the slave pens of Shraen, her spirit never broke. When she was brought to auction, a sadistic vampire named Zihain Shraen attempted to purchase her (and likely make her one of his many playthings). The mummy Dyzallin Shraen outbid the vampire; Qormintur believes that pity or compassion caused Dyzallin to save her from a fate worse than death, but in truth, Dyzallin simply wanted to spite Zihain.</p>\n<p>During her first few years as Dyzallin's slave, the ancient drow never failed to remind Qormintur that he had saved her, and that her life was his to take if she ever disobeyed him. At first, Qormintur resented Dyzallin, but as years turned into decades, a strange bond of mutual trust formed between the soulless drow and the young duergar. In a city where trust was a commodity harder to come by than adamantine or diamonds, Dyzallin formed a bond with his servant. Dyzallin kept her close to him and encouraged her personal interests in alchemy. As a reward for her service, Dyzallin has promised to transform her into a mummy. So far, she hasn't considered the offer very seriously; after all, at barely a century old, she's young for a duergar.</p>\n<p>Appearances matter in Shraen, so despite Qormintur's trusted position, Dyzallin still makes her display her slave brands on her forearms. As Dyzallin's seneschal, Qormintur takes care of many administrative tasks for him, including buying and selling magic items and other slaves. This position has often put her into contact with the same duergar slavers who once brought ruin to her family. For now, she is forced to hide her feelings, but when the opportunity presents itself, she will not hesitate to exact her revenge. She is more than capable of doing just that-Qormintur is a potent combat alchemist and often leads Dyzallin's forces against urdefhans and other threats. Dyzallin tasked Qormintur with marshalling his forces from Shraen to the lost pyramid of Xul-Khundur, and with securing the site so Dyzallin could study the magic orb at the pyramid in peace. After Dyzallin returned to Shraen with the orb, Qormintur organized guards and has continued her master's research to unearth more of the pyramid's secrets. This research hasn't met with many results so far, and Qormintur is starting to get bored and to wonder whether she's been abandoned. Despite her loyalty to Dyzallin, Qormintur is painfully aware that she doesn't really belong in Shraen, but also that she can never return to her people. Now that she has spent time outside of Shraen and out of Dyzallin's domineering presence, a new thirst for independence is brewing inside her.</p>\n<p>Qormintur is a lean, young duergar woman who wears a fine blue cloak over beautifully crafted mithral armor. Her forearms bear sinister-looking brands that match those on her armor and cloak; these brands mark her and her equipment as property of Dyzallin. Her eyes are cold and betray a hint of sadness.</p>",
