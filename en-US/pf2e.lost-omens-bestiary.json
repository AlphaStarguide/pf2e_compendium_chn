After a kun sacrifices their power for a noble heart by bathing in the sun's rays, they transform into this majestic bird, which eschews violence unless they must fight to stay free.</p>\n<p>A peng doesn't seek danger or thrills; they want only to make their long voyages and fly without disruption. However, they sometimes come into conflict with dragons and other high-flying creatures that would hunt them or block their path. Although it's unclear to mortals what purpose a peng's journeys serve, celestial powers related to air or freedom will sometimes ask their mortal followers to assist a peng in its journey.</p>\n<p>A peng's calm and steady nature is so strong that its mere presence can quell storms and still winds. Spotting a peng is undoubtedly a sign of good luck for sailors and mariners—a feeling shared with most others lucky enough to lay eyes on these rare and beautiful creatures. When the sky is clear and blue with gentle weather for an extended period, such fine conditions can be attributed to the presence of an unseen peng.</p>",

In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

The Great Flood towers with their giant serpent body and nine humanoid heads, each one with a different personality, though all serve the same purpose—to vanquish all signs of life that shouldn't be where they are. This creature intends to maintain the balance of the universe, ensuring that nothing takes up more space than necessary. Unfortunately, the judgment of where someone or something should be is only seen and weighed by the 18 eyes of the Great Flood, with little regard to mortal input.</p>\n<p>The Great Flood is an immortal, or at least ageless, being who hibernates for 12 years at a stretch. On the thirteenth year, they emerge from the depths of the oceans and begin weighing the state of the world and the environments closest to their resting place: should the first thing they see on dry land be destroyed? Each of the Great Flood's nine heads lends their thoughts and insights to this deliberation, and upon reaching a consensus, they'll either carry on to the next location or they'll drown the land, immersing miles of dry land in salty waters from the ocean. In instances where they perceive the excess life as particularly problematic, they'll even decide to poison the waters with their bitter breath to ensure that nothing survives the judgment they've decreed. The Great Flood, despite its inherently destructive nature, isn't actually bloodthirsty and will often afford an opportunity for poor townsfolk to state their case and beg for the lives of their town to be saved. While the Great Flood has the capacity for mercy and consideration, the godlike creature stands adamant once they've made their decision. One or two of the heads might feel a twinge of guilt and tell a small joke to the townsfolk, relieving themselves of the mental pressure, before murdering an entire village.</p>\n<p>The nine personalities of the serpentine creature often run into contention with each other. One is a perfectionist, while another is aloof; one is assertive, while another is playful; one is capricious, while another is suspicious; one is ambitious, while the other is a people pleaser. The last one is quiet and secretive, only ever whispering to the heads closest to them. Though the heads squabble like siblings, they eventually always make a compromise.</p>",

In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey.

The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them.

For reasons unknown, beirans are particularly subservient to these hags and will often flock to one in large numbers. Under a winter hag, the fey will make a bad cold snap worse for a suffering town. Fires will be extinguished, wood ruined, food stolen, all of which suit the mysterious tastes of the winter hag and her preference for joyless landscapes. What the beirans receive from this relationship is uncertain, though some fey academics believe it's possible that the first beirans were created by winter hags, much in the same way that the green men created leshies.</p>\n<p>While beirans are most common in northern lands such as Irrisen and the Land of the Linnorm Kings, they also have a surprising presence in the Shining Kingdoms. When Queen Elvanna of Irrisen opened up portals to the Eternal Winter of Irrisen, several of them arrived in the town of Heldren in Taldor, and even today, some still haunt the woods around it. Eighteen years ago in Falcon's Hollow, a particularly nasty batch of beirans were involved in the Carnival of Tears, an icy circus that left many townsfolk dead in its wake before adventurers dismantled it. Winters in Kyonin are often heralded by swarms of fiend-touched beirans flooding in from the Tanglebriar, leaving the Wylderhearts on fey duty for months at a time.</p>",

The power from the nurtured egg hatching is enough to power a draconic ascension ritual, and whatever power lingers transforms the koi into an imugi to continue the cycle. The kind of imperial dragon that the imugi becomes depends on where it chooses to nurture the koi egg. Imugi strongly prefer long-finned koi, and Tian koi farmers have learned to keep a separate pool of these butterfly koi away from the others they tend, as imugi tend to displace quite a bit of water—and koi—when swooping down to snatch an egg they want.</p>\n<p>Though imugi have some power over rain and storms, most aren't powerful enough to exact a true sense of weather control. Many are known for their benevolence, and some villages even rely on imugi's forays out of streams or lakes, bringing rains during the growing season. Imugi have as wide a range of temperaments as the dragons they become, and some are notorious for how their impatience twists into a foul temper or an arrogance that flicks people aside as if they were bugs.

Magic is chaos, and channeling arcane forces is less akin to exerting one's will over the world and more like surfing on a bolt of lightning through a world-shaking storm and hoping to steer it without falling off.

Legend claims it was this overenthusiastic playfulness that caused the first of their kind to be banished from heaven, cursed to gather wealth and never let it go. Whatever the case, each pixiu has an uncanny ability to sniff out gold, which it loves to eat. Curiously, a pixiu's touch is also able to sunder curses and censure malign spirits, perhaps a remnant of its lost divinity.</p>\n<p>Due to its celestial background and ability to exorcise curses, a pixiu is also believed to be a bringer and protector of prosperity, attracting good fortune and fending off evil spirits. Its heavenly origins and love of wealth may be the reason why imperial dragons have cared for them since time immemorial, valuing them as guardians and loyal companions. In particular, underworld dragons employ pixius to expand their hoards, and many sovereign dragons value them as status symbols. In dragon-ruled realms across Tian Xia, the presence of a pixiu within a community is seen as a sign of its draconic patron's approval and goodwill.</p>\n<p>Despite the protection of imperial dragons, the lure of wealth is still enough to drive some to attack a pixiu. Although a pixiu will rarely forgive an attacker, it prefers to withdraw peacefully from those it judges as purehearted but desperate.

They have thin, almost-skeletal bodies with strong rear legs that resemble a bear's, front legs like a badger's, and a head like a hare's with humanoid ears. A rompo tends to be timid on its own; it avoids other creatures and typically flees in the presence of larger animals. Though no more intelligent than any other beast, it usually acts with extreme paranoia, dodging traps or ambushes with an uncanny acumen. When danger is present, a rompo utters a loud cry to afford itself space to run and hides by using its body's natural color-shifting fur as camouflage.</p>\n<p>Although rompos sport the perfect physical features to act as predators, they tend to live their lives as solitary scavengers of leftover corpses. Rompos prefer to avoid hunting for themselves since they risk sustaining injuries in the process. It's not uncommon for rompos to follow other predators for hours, waiting for an opportunity to feast on the leftover remains of a hunt.</p>\n<p>Once a rompo gains access to a meal, it takes several minutes circling the corpse to make sure the area is clear. As it begins to feast, it lets out a whimpering cry that fascinates and compels other creatures to keep away so that the rompo can feed in peace. Due to its constant feeding on decaying flesh, a rompo's mouth is filled with rot, parasites, and deadly pathogens. Its bite can impart these combined infections as a dangerous disease known as rompo chills. The disease causes its victim to tremble uncontrollably, lightly at first but eventually developing into a violent shaking that ends with the victim's death. Despite their cautious nature, rompos always seem to linger close to creatures they infect with rompo chills; though they remain unseen while the victim lives, they emerge when that victim finally succumbs, in order to feed on the corpse.</p>",

Visiting petitioners are all too eager to provide, for it's said that when a sea dragon is pleased, the rain is gentle and plentiful. In contrast, when they're angered, the storm spares none from its fury.</p>\n<p>Despite common Tian belief, civilization hardly lives at the mercy of the sea dragons, for most are subjects of kingdoms sworn to assist mortals. Most sea dragons are subjects of one of the four sea dragon kings, whose nation or united territories are based out in the Embaral Ocean, Ivory Sea, Okaiyo Ocean, and Songil Sea. Given the lack of native sea dragons on the Plane of Water, it's theorized that these kingdoms might be remnants of a mass exodus from the Boundless Sea. The sea dragon's own myths say their kings of old took oaths to escape persecution from the Elemental Lord Kelizandri. While it's uncertain if the Brackish Emperor yet seeks to exterminate the sea dragons, most uphold the sworn promise as part of their cultural heritage or in honor of their forebears.</p>",

Native to the underground tunnels of the Five Kings Mountains, the reptiles have been domesticated to serve as beasts of burden within the Depths and sprawling web of passages beyond. Zoologists theorize that they are a part of the same reptile family as zetogekis, as the two share a similar build and other physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Draft lizards within the vicinity of Highhelm have adapted their diet to feed mainly on grindlegrubs. However, residual behavior suggests in lean times or before domestication they would devour stones for sustenance. The animals can still be observed habitually gnawing on boulders or large stones, cracking them with their powerful jaws and seeming to savor the taste as they roll the debris around in their mouths. Overworked draft lizards will stray from their handler's control in order to consume rocks, only to return back to their path with a new undercurrent of purpose.</p>\n<p>Normally as docile as any other beast of burden, the draft lizards of Highhelm will defend themselves if attacked by predators from the Darklands. Curiously, the lizards have an intense hatred for hryngars, attacking them without any prompting or hesitation. No dwarven records indicate teaching this behavior during the domestication of the animals, leaving its origins a mystery. Some caravanners even claim that the reptiles can sense the presence of hryngars, giving advanced warning of attacks by hissing menacingly into the darkness.</p>\n<p>Though too large to be exceptionally dexterous, with careful training some draft lizards can be taught performative tricks. The Rolling Wheel is particularly known for a trio of reptiles that balance on their tails, catch hurled boulders in their jaws, and other stunts. The spectacle is well known in Highhelm, considered one of the big acts that the group performs. This has led to some younger dwarves attempting to teach their animals the same feats, mostly resulting in failure and light property damage in the Depths.</p>",

Some guess it might have been a deal to fulfill personal ambition, to go from those tasked with selecting rulers to becoming the rulers themselves.

In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

Unlike mules found elsewhere on Golarion, augdunars are capable of producing offspring—though significantly fewer than ordinary equines. This has led to a steady, but controlled, stock of the creatures, allowing for the population to be selfsustaining. Augdunars are smaller than typical mules to accommodate dwarven height, measuring about four and a half feet tall and weighing between 400 and 600 pounds.</p>\n<p>Because of their ability to carry loads beyond that of the traditional mule, in addition to the ability to breed amongst themselves, augdunars are a frequent target of thieves or opportunistic merchants. No Highhelm citizen worth their stone willingly sells an augdunar to outsiders, so attempted thefts on the road are common. Unfortunately for these robbers, the mules are quite loyal to their owners and bray loudly whenever a stranger handles their leads. Combined with a heavy kick to the skull from the animal, any attempts to make off with an augdunar have low odds of succeeding.</p>\n<p>While rare, small groups of the augdunar have broken away from dwarven control over the years and created feral colonies in the Five Kings Mountains. These colonies are largely safe from ordinary predators, such as wolves, and graze on mountainside plants. Due to their low birthrate, feral augdunars don't need to have their population controlled, though caravanners do attempt to capture and redomesticate them in an effort to increase profit.</p>\n<p>Despite being natural beasts of burden, dwarves don't often use augdunars as mounts. The mules seem to have an instinctive dislike of riders, to which the deep bite marks and hoofprints left in those who try can attest. That's not to say that some haven't succeeded, however. Those who put forth the effort required to create a bond with an augdunar find that their persistence can pay off.

As fire became lava, wood became forests, water the seas, lakes, and rivers, and metal the veins of precious minerals, so earth became the land, the stone, the mountains. By way of logic, if there exist such environments and entities today, then earth dragons must exist too. Or have existed, once upon a primeval time.</p>\n<p>And yet among the imperial dragons today there are only sovereign dragons, who leave serpentine skeletons behind upon death in place of rock, stone, or land. The dragons' innate spellcasting, weakness to unheated iron, and other traits highly suggest that they're associated with elemental earth. The rest of their powers have little to no such association, instead centered on the mysteries of the metaphysical spirit and mind.</p>\n<p>There's no clear explanation for why sovereign dragons are the way they are today. Some guess it might have been a deal to fulfill personal ambition, to go from those tasked with selecting rulers to becoming the rulers themselves. Others wonder if the lands of Tian Xia were corrupted in the past, and the earth dragons walked away from their elemental natures to save themselves. Perhaps they too became empyreal dragons, but then returned to the lands of mortals when no suitable ruler rose to the throne.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>When the imperial dragons first arrived in the Universe, each was well-attuned to the elemental planes they hailed from. As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

Natives of the Netherworld, these occult dragons are at home in the darkness, using it to their advantage both in and out of battle. Umbral dragons rarely worry about fighting fairly, emerging from hiding to strike unwary foes and using their magical breath without compunction. Similarly, in social situations, they often remain in the shadows, operating through other creatures. Even in direct conversation, they frequently obscure their true intent, preferring to avoid ever being pinned down with a solid answer.</p>\n<p>While umbral dragons are rarely altruistic, their preferred diet creates a strange dichotomy that attracts other creatures to them as a potential source of safety, especially in the Netherworld. While much of the multiverse sees undead as a dire threat, for umbral dragons, undead are a tasty snack. Umbral dragons find the flavor of necrotic flesh irresistible and the void energy of incorporeal undead a potent spice, making them one of the few creatures in existence known to hunt the unliving as a source of food.</p>",

As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

By way of logic, if there exist such environments and entities today, then earth dragons must exist too. Or have existed, once upon a primeval time.</p>\n<p>And yet among the imperial dragons today there are only sovereign dragons, who leave serpentine skeletons behind upon death in place of rock, stone, or land. The dragons' innate spellcasting, weakness to unheated iron, and other traits highly suggest that they're associated with elemental earth. The rest of their powers have little to no such association, instead centered on the mysteries of the metaphysical spirit and mind.</p>\n<p>There's no clear explanation for why sovereign dragons are the way they are today. Some guess it might have been a deal to fulfill personal ambition, to go from those tasked with selecting rulers to becoming the rulers themselves. Others wonder if the lands of Tian Xia were corrupted in the past, and the earth dragons walked away from their elemental natures to save themselves. Perhaps they too became empyreal dragons, but then returned to the lands of mortals when no suitable ruler rose to the throne.</p>",

As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

They constantly use these magical energies to empower their magical abilities and even their bodies, as the energy can heal wounds. A fortune dragon has a typical build for an arcane dragon, but their bodies sport a striking feature: their treasure. The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process. Fortune dragons are seekers of novel experiences. This desire for originality leads fortune dragons to approach visitors of other ancestries with curiosity, though this initial interest quickly wanes if a visitor lacks exciting qualities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions.

Instead, he's one of a rare type of fey native to the First World who enjoy causing bloody mayhem in the Material Plane. These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks are cruel-eyed, hairy fey with vaguely humanoid shapes and extra features that cause them to be easily mistaken for demons or devils. Glowing eyes, cloven hooves, menacing horns, and a pointed tail combine to create the mien of a wicked imp; his love of sudden and sadistic violence completes the impression. Almost all have jet-black skin and fur, though a few exceptions might exist.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks typically hide their features in tattered cloaks, appearing as a hunched elder or a youth in the nighttime conditions they enjoy. Such a disguise rarely holds up to any scrutiny, but that doesn't matter much to the Spring-Heeled Jack, who only needs something that offers just enough doubt for their target to move within striking distance, which can be from much farther away than most other creatures even realize. Once close enough, the Spring-Heeled Jack leaps startling distances in the blink of an eye to easily slash at a victim who had, until that moment, considered themself safe.</p>",

As they age, these research interests also broaden, with an expert in a particular river expanding into topics such as the water cycle, ecology, or the Plane of Water. Sage dragons interested in religious topics often worship Nethys or a god dedicated to knowledge, such as Gruhastha, Qi Zhong, or Ydajisk.

By way of logic, if there exist such environments and entities today, then earth dragons must exist too. Or have existed, once upon a primeval time.</p>\n<p>And yet among the imperial dragons today there are only sovereign dragons, who leave serpentine skeletons behind upon death in place of rock, stone, or land. The dragons' innate spellcasting, weakness to unheated iron, and other traits highly suggest that they're associated with elemental earth. The rest of their powers have little to no such association, instead centered on the mysteries of the metaphysical spirit and mind.</p>\n<p>There's no clear explanation for why sovereign dragons are the way they are today. Some guess it might have been a deal to fulfill personal ambition, to go from those tasked with selecting rulers to becoming the rulers themselves. Others wonder if the lands of Tian Xia were corrupted in the past, and the earth dragons walked away from their elemental natures to save themselves. Perhaps they too became empyreal dragons, but then returned to the lands of mortals when no suitable ruler rose to the throne.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>When the imperial dragons first arrived in the Universe, each was well-attuned to the elemental planes they hailed from. As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

These hardy creatures have adapted to harsh arctic climates, able to survive indefinitely in sub-zero temperatures. Rime dragons are shades of white and pale blue that perfectly camouflage them in their natural habitat, resembling glaciers or mounds of snow when curled up. They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey. Due to their natural lower body temperature, they can slow their digestive tract, which allows them to live a long time on little food. Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly.

Their terrifying spores also mean that most survivors of their attacks tend to be disoriented and delirious, relating accounts of the monster that are distorted by confusion and fear. This, along with the natural variance between different Melfesh Monsters, means that even the most diligent of researchers will come across contradictory evidence. Even if they learn from all the prior information collected over the years, they're still often caught off guard when trying to hunt down and fell the threat since the new Melfesh Monster might have an ability never seen before.

Manananggals use their long, hollow tongues to drain victims' blood from vital organs such as the liver, and the resulting odd drainage marks make it difficult to determine the exact nature of a victim's death. This mystery typically leads to confusion, terror, and mistrust among communities, which most manananggals savor. While they fly, manananggals make a distinctive ticking sound, leading some to refer to the creatures as \"tik-tiks,\" and badly affected communities descend into fearful chaos at the first reports of this telltale noise.</p>\n<p>Manananggals share their cannibalistic, body-separating traits with other types of tanggals, such as penanggalans, though a number of characteristics set them apart.

            "publicNotes": "<p>When the imperial dragons first arrived in the Universe, each was well-attuned to the elemental planes they hailed from. As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

The innate magic that flows through these dragons causes them to draw particular metals to their bodies like magnets or, in some cases, naturally grow these skymetals on their bodies.

Adamantine dragons are typically steadfast and loyal. Once they commit to a certain purpose, changing their minds is nigh impossible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions. Regardless of their names, these dragons share a number of characteristics: their ability to tap into magical energies, intensified might and cunning as they grow older, and an inclination to hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth.</p>\n<h2>Draconic Spellcasters</h2>\n<p>Each dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon's Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give them the spells outlined in their sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each rank. You might also want to increase the dragon's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.</p>",

Which is to say, they are completely and utterly incorrect. Of course, having a smoke cloud or child's drawing running around one's home might be vastly preferable to a delight dragon.</p>\n<p>As residents of the Outer Plane Elysium, delight dragons are embodiments of the plane's proclivity toward joy, mischief, passion, and spontaneity. Their massive gossamer wings refract the light of a thousand rainbows between translucent layers. Purple-green scales shimmer in opalescent splendor, while a long, sinuous tail flicks in spiral figures, darting to catch the feet out from under distracted observers. A pair of feathery antennae direct the delight dragon to their next source of amusement—whether play, treat, or general amusement, all surely to become a great time in the dragon's presence, whether a plane's denizens know it or not.</p>\n<p>As self-proclaimed defenders of games, whimsy, and the freedom to sow a little chaos, delight dragons are often found on the front line against those that would strip such choice away from others. Demonic forces deployed at the Worldwound whispered of the \"lights of doom,\" massive rainbows that heralded the approach of a delight dragon. The winged crusader would descend upon these fiends with claws and fangs, cackling all the while.</p>",

Their faces are masks of terror; their lips curl back in a snarl to expose brutish grins of dagger-like fangs, pock-marked by vicious stomach acids that give their latent breath the malodorous turpitude that stings the senses almost unto dizziness.

Ugvashi first arrived in the Impossible Lands onboard the Thousand and One ships of Maharajah Khiben-Sald, alongside peafowl, giant squirrels, and other fauna from Vudra. In the modern day, ugvashi are such a recognized sight that many people forget they aren't a native species. Though some feral populations exist, mainly on the island of Jalmeray, the hostile environs of Nex and the Mana Wastes mean ugvashi mainly appear in domestic settings, usually as working beasts among the Nearic halflings of western Nex.</p>\n<p>Though ugvashi are mostly harmless, they're somewhat more dangerous than their smaller cousins, causing a stir when reckless citizens attempt to pet the creatures. Ugvashi scales are razor sharp, and their large and blunted digging claws can be deadly due to their size. People who attempt to steal the animals or ride them without training often receive moderate cuts for their trouble. However, ugvashi are generally curious and very friendly, and more than one visitor or wilderness explorer has found a baby ugvashi toddling after them and pawing at their boots.</p>\n<p>Nearic halflings also paint their ugvashi with distinctive warding patterns and sigils, some of which are actually effective and provide a surprise for opportunistic thieves or predators. Though due consideration is spent on protecting an ugvashi's cargo, the animals themselves have proven to be tempting targets as well, especially for their meat. With blighted landscapes making animal husbandry impractical and magical pollution leaving local seafood with a distinct aftertaste, a number of Nexian and Mana Wastes peoples have developed a taste for ugvashi. Since the animals lack an aggressive temperament, it often falls to their caretakers to discourage such predations through whatever means necessary.</p>\n<p>Ugvashi shed their scales each winter, allowing for the plates to be collected safely and turned into quality armor and other pieces of craftwork. Nearic halflings rarely trade or sell these items, however, out of fear that they might lead to more people trying to steal their ugvashi.</p>",

His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born-Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds.</p>\n<p>To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year.</p>\n<p>Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches. No adventurer has yet braved the treacherous expanse to find and defeat him.</p>\n<p>While Krampus is most infamous for tracking and punishing the naughty, his own sins often inform his vindictive responses to others' misdeeds. An incarnation of Krampus who arose from irrepressible greed might possess abilities that better reflect his fierce miserly behavior, emphasizing less the abduction of miscreants and more the disproportionate punishment of thieves and robbers. Such a variant Krampus might arise in different cultures that tell different stories about Krampus, or Krampus's powers and nature might drift between incarnations each time he is defeated and arises anew elsewhere in the world the following year. In these cultures or incarnations, Krampus represents a remorseless yet generous spirit who's willing to grant boons to the truly worthy while tormenting any who fail his morality tests.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for people in regions terrorized by this Krampus, his definition of \"any who fail his morality tests\" tend to be nearly everyone but the most innocent and generous of people.</p>",

They live adjacent to the civilizations of Tian Xia, ready to aid mortal affairs and prove their worth. For some sea dragons, providing assistance in matters of the weather and arcane knowledge is a duty. For others, it's a perk that leads to valuable tributes or delicious meals. Visiting petitioners are all too eager to provide, for it's said that when a sea dragon is pleased, the rain is gentle and plentiful. In contrast, when they're angered, the storm spares none from its fury.</p>\n<p>Despite common Tian belief, civilization hardly lives at the mercy of the sea dragons, for most are subjects of kingdoms sworn to assist mortals. Most sea dragons are subjects of one of the four sea dragon kings, whose nation or united territories are based out in the Embaral Ocean, Ivory Sea, Okaiyo Ocean, and Songil Sea. Given the lack of native sea dragons on the Plane of Water, it's theorized that these kingdoms might be remnants of a mass exodus from the Boundless Sea. The sea dragon's own myths say their kings of old took oaths to escape persecution from the Elemental Lord Kelizandri. While it's uncertain if the Brackish Emperor yet seeks to exterminate the sea dragons, most uphold the sworn promise as part of their cultural heritage or in honor of their forebears.</p>",

In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

Although this large, solitary beast bears a slight resemblance to the common draft ox, it's a highly aggressive and territorial carnivore who stalks and devours its prey. An aoyin dwells high in the mountains, rarely being seen by common folk. However, during lean winters, an aoyin might descend from its mountain home in search of food, resulting in gruesome encounters with nearby settlements. It's believed that a single aoyin can decimate the population of an entire village, only to retreat into the nearby mountains once it has satiated its hunger. An aoyin, even a herd of the creatures, is primarily driven by hunger and other natural urges. Outside of its natural habitat, an aoyin might occasionally be kept by those who revel in bloodlust. Even with magical control, a captive aoyin is more likely to turn on its handlers than obey commands. As an uncontrolled weapon, however, a hungry aoyin poses a terrible threat to most communities. Tales in certain isolated areas claim that the growling call of an aoyin can drive those unlucky enough to hear it into a frenzy of hunger and violence. Villages will be found consumed by infighting without any sign of an aoyin even entering its borders. Although it's possible a powerful variant of this creature might possess this ability, most of these stories are inspired by the terrible magic available to those who understand the aoyin's secrets and are spread when villages collapse through magic compulsions or mundane infighting.</p>",

They prefer discreet, non-violent ways of procuring these biological materials and shy from combat, seemingly possessed of a nervous temperament. Nexian fleshforgers quip this is entirely reasonable, as skinskitters are little more than nervous systems wrapped in dying skin. Nexian guards who actually have to hunt these fleshforged pests aren't quite as jocular; confronted by the oddly childlike pleas of these cornered puddles of flesh, hair, and eyes, many recruits simply choose to leave the city watch.</p>\n<p>On occasion, curious scholars or soldiers have questioned why skinskitters pursue organic tissue, and whether this is a simple instinct or in pursuit of a grander purpose. Most fleshforgers assume that skinskitters consume organic matter to repair themselves in a process similar to eating, and give the matter no further thought, showing no more interest in the creatures than a smith might show in a bead of melted slag. The most paranoid Nexians claim that skinskitters are attempting to build something out of their collections of cast-off skin, perhaps even reconstructing themselves into fleshforged conformers. There is no recorded evidence of this ever occurring, however—if the creatures have any awareness at all, it's more likely that skinskitters are driven by the basest of instincts to better themselves through the same methods used in their creation but lack the understanding and self-direction to ever succeed.</p>",

The flames and smoke of the cities keeps it at bay, but in the darkness, it is at home. The dwarves of Highhelm have learned how to live with the threat, but those traveling deeper into the mountain must always remain vigilant.</p>\n<p>In the swamps of the Tanglebriar, food is difficult to come by. So when a grievously wounded demon, a shemhazian known as Gratheyr, fled into its waters to escape from his enemies, every starving creature swarmed at the smell of blood. As the creatures devoured his flesh, they were corrupted by his Abyssal blood, and their hunger only grew. They feasted until nothing but his heart remained, still beating at the center of the swarm, binding it to a single will. With its meal finished, the bloated swarm left the swamp in search of its next prey. It moved aimlessly, hunting animals and travelers alike, until a great rumble beneath the earth attracted its attention. The Bloodstorm followed the vibrations deep underground, toward the scent of sweat and the sounds of voices.</p>",

Fleshy, ribbed mosquito wings protrude from her back. She has six handless arms that taper into malformed points, which she keeps clutched to her chest like the legs of an insect's pupae. Her spindly legs also taper into points; when bloated from feeding, she must run on all eight limbs, which leave small holes in the ground as tracks.</p>\n<h2>The Swarm Seer</h2>\n<p>Few have seen the Mosquito Witch, yet almost everyone has suffered her namesake vermin at some point in time. Shimmerford summer skies shimmer with flies hatching from the river and myriad creeks, and \"wherever pests fly, the Witch can spy.\" In her Swarm Seer aspect, the Mosquito Witch is a haunting predator and verminous voyeur whose sanguineous appetites are equal to her fascination with societies. She keeps tabs on every inhabitant with parasocial glee, obsessing over their superstitions and abandoned trinkets-especially any representations of herself.</p>\n<p>This Mosquito Witch rarely acts with outright malice or to bring direct harm to those around her. However, her haunting appearance, alien values, and tendency to express emotions with sky-blotting swarms inspires terror in her neighbors. Depending on the circumstances she might represent a fearsome and ineffable ally, a demigod of fecundity, or a terrible foe who long ago lost patience with humanity.</p>",

Their minute wings cannot support flight, so they rely on magic to fly. They have long tails that can be up to five times the length of their bodies.

Aigamuxas resemble large humans with smooth hollows where their eyes should be, but their eyes are actually embedded in the soles of their feet. They sport long, sharp claws and teeth that they use to tear their prey apart once they catch them. A moving aigamuxa's odd gait resembles dancing more than a typical walk or run, but its speed is alarming, if difficult to correctly estimate at a distance.</p>\n<p>An aigamuxa's unique physiology makes catching prey difficult, and most aigamuxas are constantly hungry. When pursuing prey, an aigamuxa must occasionally stop to lift its feet in order to regain their bearings. Most stand on their hands while looking around, which allows them to immediately backflip back into a run. An aigamuxa's eyes are generally resistant to the sands of their native desert habitats, but irritants such as chilies or caltrops can seriously impair their hunting ability, and desert travelers often carry a bag of these in case they need to deal with an aigamuxa.</p>\n<p>Clever aigamuxas know that attacking wandering prey can be very dangerous, instead using their powerful hands to dig deep into sand dunes or dirt and wait to ambush passersby. Aigamuxas are particularly good at hiding in their home environments, and unfortunate travelers often don't notice the barely visible eyes of an aigamuxa until it's too late.</p>",

In their original forms, jiidons are extremely difficult to distinguish from an ordinary rat and often even finds a home leading its non-sapient kin.</p>\n<p>After eating the discarded fingernails of a humanoid, however, a jiidon can assume the shape of the clippings' owner, resembling the subject in all of the obvious and superficial ways, with several subtle differences. Their ears are a little larger and sometimes come to a small point. Their teeth continue to grow for their entire lifetimes, so they must regularly chew on stones, bark, and other hard materials to file their teeth down and conceal their true nature. The whiskers that grow from the sides of their faces also require daily trimming.</p>\n<p>Jiidons are mostly harmless, but their powers provoke alarm among those who know of them. Mothers scold their children not to clip their nails after nightfall, lest a lurking jiidon seize a sliver that got lost in the dark. Though as cautious as any rat, most jiidons want nothing more than to transform and take a place in humanoid society. In order to reduce suspicion, they've been known to target those who are unpopular among their neighbors. The gratitude they feel when they do replace a humanoid can sometimes be seen in their actions, revealing the fact that the target has been replaced or endearing jiidons to those who didn't appreciate the original's attitude.</p>\n<p>Jiidons from large families will often seek a role that grants them access to nail trimmings, such as a cleaner or doctor, and pass the gift of humanoid form through the family.</p>",

By way of logic, if there exist such environments and entities today, then earth dragons must exist too. Or have existed, once upon a primeval time.</p>\n<p>And yet among the imperial dragons today there are only sovereign dragons, who leave serpentine skeletons behind upon death in place of rock, stone, or land. The dragons' innate spellcasting, weakness to unheated iron, and other traits highly suggest that they're associated with elemental earth. The rest of their powers have little to no such association, instead centered on the mysteries of the metaphysical spirit and mind.</p>\n<p>There's no clear explanation for why sovereign dragons are the way they are today. Some guess it might have been a deal to fulfill personal ambition, to go from those tasked with selecting rulers to becoming the rulers themselves. Others wonder if the lands of Tian Xia were corrupted in the past, and the earth dragons walked away from their elemental natures to save themselves. Perhaps they too became empyreal dragons, but then returned to the lands of mortals when no suitable ruler rose to the throne.</p>",

These hardy creatures have adapted to harsh arctic climates, able to survive indefinitely in sub-zero temperatures. Rime dragons are shades of white and pale blue that perfectly camouflage them in their natural habitat, resembling glaciers or mounds of snow when curled up. They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey. Due to their natural lower body temperature, they can slow their digestive tract, which allows them to live a long time on little food. Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly. These they carefully contain while researching mitigation strategies should the pathogens be reintroduced to the world.</p>",

These dragons are as calm as the brackish waters, as perfectly patient as any crocodile mistaken for debris, and as ancient as any fear held of the realms they dwell within. To the many cultures they've stalked since the first humanoids dared to build their dwellings near brackish fens, a bog dragon is a terror consigned to the nebulous realm of monster and abomination. Though most have been relegated to the stuff of legends and the mythic nightmares of river valley city-states, bog dragons are still out there, lurking beneath the loam.</p>\n<p>Bog dragons haunt the parables of old, their primal characteristics a raw expression of a primeval world that rebukes the tyranny of time's progression. Their bodies are those of a belly-dragging thing, corpulent and richly shielded by a scabrous hide of spurs and spines. Their claws, much like their wings, are feeble things, vestiges of a more graceful draconic concept that only the eldest bog archdragon might attain. Their faces are masks of terror; their lips curl back in a snarl to expose brutish grins of dagger-like fangs, pock-marked by vicious stomach acids that give their latent breath the malodorous turpitude that stings the senses almost unto dizziness.

A linnorm egg remains viable for many years, protected by a tough, leathery skin easily mistaken for stone.

Newborn linnorms remain hidden in their nests for several months as they mature, growing large enough to hunt on their own and setting out into the world. These linnorms are roughly the equivalent of older teenagers when compared to other species. Younger linnorms, while still primal creatures with a strong tie to the First World, haven't yet manifested most of their magical powers. They still can't breathe deadly fire or lightning or see invisible creatures, and, most importantly, they can be slain without prompting the linnorm's legendary death curse. They do, however, have voracious appetites, consuming any living thing to fuel their rapid growth. A linnorm is most vulnerable during this time; scouts who find tracks of a young linnorm quickly muster a hunting party of stalwart and experienced warriors to track the creature down and kill it quickly-before they draw the attention of the linnorm's father.</p>",

As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

Their popularity invariably led to the establishment of feral populations, as these naturally nervous creatures used their homing ability to establish protective flocks. Readily agitated, these rat-sized dragonets are dangerous in large numbers. They are easily overlooked in urban areas, however, as familiarity breeds complacency from those who see these dragonets every day with little incident.</p>\n<p>Many pest drakes are a dun or dusty brown in color, though some flocks retain the brilliant blues, reds, and greens of their captive relatives. Both varieties have many tiny spines that resemble hairs and short, stubby noses that earned them the derogatory nickname of \"dragon-winged rats.\" Much like other urban animals, pest drakes are highly adaptable, adept at scavenging food from trash piles or discarded foodstuffs. People likewise find the tiny dragons cute and will feed them, despite laws or warnings.</p>\n<p>Pest drakes live in cities and ruins. They build their lairs atop hidden stone ledges and within inaccessible monument alcoves. There, their acidic mess often does irreparable damage before it is discovered and removed. Such lairs are usually full of tiny trinkets swiped off the street, such as earrings, coins, and nails they pull from cart wheels.</p><hr /><p>Though dragonets are smaller and lacking the raw power of great dragons, they are every bit as varied and fascinating as their larger relatives. Like dragons, dragonets have strong ties to magic. These ties influence the contrasting natures exhibited by different dragonet types. For example, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.QIXc18xHrEWDmtKW]{Fey Dragonets} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core-2.Actor.Zh8awPHA7DZxTboc]{House Drakes} make fascinating pets and companions, and thus are a popular familiar for spellcasters. Tidepool dragonets, on the other hand, are arrogant and untamable.</p>\n<p>Assuming dragonets are harmless due to their size, or the fact that they often live near people, is dangerous. Pest drakes, for instance, are weak and shy individually but are inclined to form dangerous swarms when unsettled. By contrast, pearl dragonets are gentle oddities that seem naturally friendly.</p>\n<p>Dragonets range in size from little bigger than songbirds to no larger than house cats. Unlike most great dragons, they stop growing after reaching maturity. They vary greatly in intelligence; fey dragonets are known for their tricks and wit, while feral racing drakes have the average problem solving capacity of a pigeon. Each type of dragonet has its own lairing and hoarding habits, and they have unique abilities that reveal their magical nature.</p>",

Most sea dragons are subjects of one of the four sea dragon kings, whose nation or united territories are based out in the Embaral Ocean, Ivory Sea, Okaiyo Ocean, and Songil Sea. Given the lack of native sea dragons on the Plane of Water, it's theorized that these kingdoms might be remnants of a mass exodus from the Boundless Sea. The sea dragon's own myths say their kings of old took oaths to escape persecution from the Elemental Lord Kelizandri.

The people of Alkenstar typically find conventional arms sufficient for battling creatures who wander out of the Mana Wastes, but recent increases in activity from the fleshforges of Nex and the necromantic chambers of Geb have spurred the people of the city into a flurry of defensive innovations. Created by an experimental collaboration between the city's gunsmiths and clockwork inventors, the clockwork cannoneer provides exceptional mobile firepower. Two cannon-arms swing at the sides of the 15-foot-tall automaton, and its body contains a hopper of cannonballs that are replenished by engineers when the creature is wound up for duty. Triple-walled reinforcement on the cannoneer's black-powder reservoirs provides ample protection from the accidental explosions and backfires that often troubled early prototypes of the finely engineered machine. The current design combines the long-range capabilities of field artillery with the stopping power of a firedrake against engaged enemies, and its heat-tempered gear assembly minimizes warping that might cause slipping, grinding, or shaking.</p>\n<p>While reports from living artillery members serving alongside clockwork cannoneers complain of blisters, smoke inhalation, and singed eyebrows, the Grand Duchy's chief clockwork machinists have assured the city's leadership that the constructs function well within safety parameters. The clockwork cannoneer's self-sufficient construction frees crews to see to those battlefield tasks that can, for the moment, only be conducted by sentient beings.</p>\n<p>Intelligence reports from Quantium and Absalom indicate that attempts to replicate the clockwork cannoneer's design have been spectacularly unsuccessful.</p>",

In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

As cunning as they are vicious, bilokos employ deadly traps and guerrilla hunting tactics to capture prey-typically hapless explorers or, occasionally, wayward villagers, many of whom believe bilokos to be cruel ancestral spirits. The most powerful of these creatures, known as elokos, wield potent transformative magic.</p>\n<p>Bilokos have a fondness for bells, and the sound of ringing bells often indicates their presence. In addition to carrying and ringing them while out hunting, bilokos sometimes enchant bells with potent magic, or hang them on strings to serve as alarms for their encampments.</p>\n<p>Bilokos look like slender but wiry humanoids with crocodile-like heads, rust-colored skin, and blood-red eyes. They eat only the meat of humanoids, though they can survive for extended periods of time on a single meal thanks to their snakelike ability to consume a Medium humanoid creature whole. They do this by unhinging their jaws and slowly swallowing the victim from head to foot. Thanks to their acidic saliva and sharp teeth, a biloko can masticate their food into an easy-to-digest pulp, grinding flesh and bone into a compact mush, even while swallowing; thus, they do not flinch while devouring meals two or three times their own size.</p>\n<p>A recently-fed biloko can be easily recognized by their sagging, distended belly.

This distinct coloration is easy to spot, but zinbas can swim through the wet mud and soft earth of their homes to avoid being tracked by all but the most skilled pursuers. This elusiveness inspires their \"ghost serpent\" moniker.</p>\n<p>A zinba can metabolize a unique additive for its venom that converts it from a deadly poison to a healing agent, which makes zinbas particularly valuable in the eyes of healers and poachers. There is a high demand for zinbas in many markets; live serpents fetch a hefty sum, but zinba eggs are especially valuable, as zinbas reared in captivity are less willful and more likely to eat in confinement. Their elusiveness, however, leads many to search for their dens instead, which are large pools of water among remote wetlands or underground hollows near bodies of water. The water of a zinba's pool also has minor but valuable healing qualities, but removing water from a den causes it to lose its healing properties after a few hours, so most who find a den attempt to immediately make use of it.</p>\n<p>Even finding dens is a difficult prospect, since zinbas are particularly intelligent for animals and can recognize signs of travelers near their favored hiding places.

They're tasked with guarding sacred places or items, although they sometimes also protect the living from places of incredible danger. Their appearance is always preceded by numerous small purple-winged birds with a splash of yellow on their crowns; these are avatars of the ibis that nest and congregate in areas it protects. The presence of these avatars is often the only way to track these reclusive and solitary creatures. Should the solar ibis choose to appear, these little birds scatter like wild fowl. The sun bird then manifests and bathes the area in a brilliant shower of light that can blind and startle unwary and unprepared creatures in its presence.</p>\n<p>The solar ibis appears as a magnificent, large bird surrounded by a halo of brilliant light. Its black feathers shimmer with all the colors of the spectrum, casting glossy rainbows across its plumage. It has a keen sense of insight, which it uses to pass judgment as a whole on whether those before it are worthy to access what it guards. It punishes those it finds unworthy with its cleansing might.</p>\n<p>Though considered sacred by most within the Mwangi Expanse, there are still some who hunt these glorious creatures; some seek the treasures that the ibis keep, while others seek the ibis themselves, dead or alive. Some believe that the feathers of a solar ibis, when burned, create an incense that can grant holy power to those that inhale it. Others believe that its bones and feet can be ground into a powder that can destroy demons and purify the undead.</p>",

Unusually, however, the subject survives as a bipartite creature: a headless body controlled by a detached head that still thinks and speaks, and which can outlive said body's destruction. It's not uncommon for would-be dragonslayers to be sent home carrying their own heads under one arm as a lesson in humility. The unluckier ones, alas, may be kept as trophies—and, in a very literal sense, conversation pieces—while the dragon devours their greater portion.

They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey.

Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them.

These hardy creatures have adapted to harsh arctic climates, able to survive indefinitely in sub-zero temperatures. Rime dragons are shades of white and pale blue that perfectly camouflage them in their natural habitat, resembling glaciers or mounds of snow when curled up. They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey. Due to their natural lower body temperature, they can slow their digestive tract, which allows them to live a long time on little food. Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly. These they carefully contain while researching mitigation strategies should the pathogens be reintroduced to the world.</p>",

In the face of an enemy even she had no hope of redeeming, the ever-compassionate Dawnflower allowed her divine fury to escape from her lips as she struck down the primordial god, and from this act of anathema, the first executor dragons were given form. Since that moment, executor dragons represent the full wrath of the gods. Divine in nature, executor dragons typically appear to punish those who have strayed so far from the path of their deity's edicts as to begin embracing the anathema. Due to their potent nature as weapons of the divine, executor dragons are generally drawn to target not a single misbehaving follower, but entire villages, cities, or towns that have turned their backs on their gods. Many of the gods prefer not to use executor dragons as part of their punishment of mortal transgressors, and instead keep them reserved for the days of apocalyptic battles.</p>\n<p>Though many believe executor dragons are spawned from divine magic, they are fully biological creatures. Compelled by faith and devotion and disgusted by hypocrisy and base cruelty, executor dragons tend to live near human settlements, but rarely within them. They form small familial groups when young, but grow more independent as they age, seeking to claim territory uninhabited by other dragons. Their chosen lairs tend to be locations secreted away, either in the ruins of mountaintop monasteries or in the cavernous depths beneath abandoned places of worship. For the few executor dragons that live actively among non-draconic peoples, even fewer do so in their natural forms. They are sometimes found living disguised as traveling lay priests who bring healing and alms for the needy, choristers singing hymnals, wandering monastic scholars who ask challenging and conflicted questions about faith, or quiet church custodians who protect and beautify their chosen houses of worship. It's said that one or more executor dragons might have even taken up the defense of Kenebres after its near destruction at the hands of the Khorramzadeh, Storm King of the Worldwound.</p>",

These hardy creatures have adapted to harsh arctic climates, able to survive indefinitely in sub-zero temperatures. Rime dragons are shades of white and pale blue that perfectly camouflage them in their natural habitat, resembling glaciers or mounds of snow when curled up. They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey. Due to their natural lower body temperature, they can slow their digestive tract, which allows them to live a long time on little food. Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly. These they carefully contain while researching mitigation strategies should the pathogens be reintroduced to the world.</p>",

In contrast, when they're angered, the storm spares none from its fury.</p>\n<p>Despite common Tian belief, civilization hardly lives at the mercy of the sea dragons, for most are subjects of kingdoms sworn to assist mortals. Most sea dragons are subjects of one of the four sea dragon kings, whose nation or united territories are based out in the Embaral Ocean, Ivory Sea, Okaiyo Ocean, and Songil Sea. Given the lack of native sea dragons on the Plane of Water, it's theorized that these kingdoms might be remnants of a mass exodus from the Boundless Sea. The sea dragon's own myths say their kings of old took oaths to escape persecution from the Elemental Lord Kelizandri. While it's uncertain if the Brackish Emperor yet seeks to exterminate the sea dragons, most uphold the sworn promise as part of their cultural heritage or in honor of their forebears.</p>",

Sage dragons interested in religious topics often worship Nethys or a god dedicated to knowledge, such as Gruhastha, Qi Zhong, or Ydajisk.

They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey. Due to their natural lower body temperature, they can slow their digestive tract, which allows them to live a long time on little food. Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly. These they carefully contain while researching mitigation strategies should the pathogens be reintroduced to the world.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>When the imperial dragons first arrived in the Universe, each was well-attuned to the elemental planes they hailed from. As the war between the Elemental Lords raged on and the benevolent lords fell one by one, the Planes of Metal and Wood sealed themselves away. For the dragons who originated from the Corroded Core, their very existence was now at stake. These dragons flew from mountaintop to mountaintop, seeking refuge from the then-perilous Tian Xia overrun by warring yaoguai. Finally, upon the mountain peaks of Chenlun, Gossamer, Kelsang, Kimu, Kullan, Kyojin, and the Wall of Heaven, celestial beings answered the dragons' cries for help. What the dragons no longer had in elemental metal, these celestials provided through divine blessings and essence. With their nature changed, the dragons as a species survived. In time, their proximity to the sky and the deities they serve became their namesake. Their past as elemental metal dragons became but a faded memory and creation myth for all but the sky dragons themselves to remember.</p>\n<p>The sky dragons proved their gratitude with eternal service. Some became infused with the planar energies of the gods they served, becoming massive and powerful; many were among the progenitors of the modern empyreal dragon. Others stayed in the Universe, practicing their faith and perfecting the divine arts over life and spirit. Rare indeed are sky dragons who strike out on their own, wielding non-divine powers on missions unrelated to a greater will. The few who do retain much of their reclusive and contemplative nature, at least during their younger years.</p>\n<p>With the recent return of the Plane of Metal, there have been careful inquiries about sky dragons' connection to that plane. Some wonder if they might find surviving distant relations. These inquiries are not out of curiosity, but need. While being empowered by celestial beings gave the sky dragons the power to defend themselves, it didn't solve the issue of elemental deficiency. Worse, the deficiency continues despite the Corroded Core's return. Sky dragon hatchlings, from eggs or live birth, are born vulnerable, with only patches of scales or none at all. Even with exposure to large deposits of mineral or salt veins (which serve as magnets and reservoirs for elemental metal energy), it can take decades before a hatchling's scales toughen to the point that they have adequate protection to leave the lair. If the Plane of Metal has an answer to this issue—either locations that might serve as a safe birthing or hatching grounds or a way to restore the dragon's ability to absorb ambient elemental energy—it's of utmost importance that all sky dragons learn of the method and opportunity.</p>",

Unusually, however, the subject survives as a bipartite creature: a headless body controlled by a detached head that still thinks and speaks, and which can outlive said body's destruction. It's not uncommon for would-be dragonslayers to be sent home carrying their own heads under one arm as a lesson in humility. The unluckier ones, alas, may be kept as trophies—and, in a very literal sense, conversation pieces—while the dragon devours their greater portion.

At a glance, omen dragons resemble other occult dragons in appearance, save for the mirror-like interior membrane of their wings. An omen dragon's wings offer glimpses into the future. These glimpses are cloudy and vague, but generally correct, if only technically. Omen dragons have a natural compulsion to share the futures they see. These dragons have no compunctions about what the visions show and share their knowledge equally with innocent villagers as they do with wicked tyrants.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions.

The difference lies in understanding the original ratajin characteristics. No curse gave ratajin four eyes on a slender face, nor triple-jointed, hypermobile legs and multiple arms. Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra. For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can be awake only during hours devoid of sunlight.</p>\n<p>While particular curse manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin's worldview can offer a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems, working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants and scholars.</p>\n<p>Earning a ratajin's trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life's many hurdles. Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin's unique sensory experience can also cause lingering resentment.</p>",

They constantly use these magical energies to empower their magical abilities and even their bodies, as the energy can heal wounds. A fortune dragon has a typical build for an arcane dragon, but their bodies sport a striking feature: their treasure. The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process. Fortune dragons are seekers of novel experiences. This desire for originality leads fortune dragons to approach visitors of other ancestries with curiosity, though this initial interest quickly wanes if a visitor lacks exciting qualities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragons come in myriad forms, with many having magical abilities or connections to magic. Some dragons draw greater power from magic than others, allowing them to manifest abilities or alter their physiques with prolonged exposure to magic. These dragons become more powerful as they age and strengthen their connections with their magical origins. Scholars debate the classification of these dragons, with some preferring the name magical dragons and others using traditional dragons due to their connection to specific magical traditions. Regardless of their names, these dragons share a number of characteristics: their ability to tap into magical energies, intensified might and cunning as they grow older, and an inclination to hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth.</p>\n<h2>Draconic Spellcasters</h2>\n<p>Each dragon features a sidebar on spellcasting dragons of that type. To make a dragon spellcaster, remove the dragon's Draconic Frenzy and Draconic Momentum abilities, and give them the spells outlined in their sidebar. You can swap out any number of these with other spells, provided you keep the same number of spells for each rank. You might also want to increase the dragon's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier by 1 or 2 to reflect their mastery of magic.</p>",

A faint shimmer in the air, like the waves over a hot stone, hints at where their other half would be.</p>\n<p>Despite the bizarre appearance of the k'nonna, they have no trouble balancing or performing everyday tasks that might be impeded by missing half of their bodies. They are extremely dexterous, able to perform complex tasks with only a single hand. The nature of their missing half has so far defied explanation; it is not invisible, nor does it exist on another plane, yet it seems to exert enough force for a k'nonna to walk like a human being.</p>\n<p>No one is certain of the k'nonna's origins, except that they are not of this world and not descended from any known mortal creature. Banishment magic has no effect on them, implying they do not come from another plane. They are intelligent but difficult to communicate with-they speak only in half words and hear only half of what anyone says. K'nonna are also much less interested in talking than eating, and humanoids happen to be their favorite meal. The remains of a k'nonna's victim are unmistakable, as they only consume half the body.</p>\n<p>Stories tell of the half-people's love for gifts, especially jewelry. Offerings of rings and necklaces easily distract a k'nonna long enough for prey to escape. Particularly bold victims might try to trick a k'nonna into wearing a bracelet that binds their one visible wrist or ankle to immobilize them, though the tactic is not foolproof, as a k'nonna displeased with their gifts will hunt the person who displeased them for the rest of their days.</p>",

These terrifying creatures mimic their natural surroundings to ambush greedy adventurers.</p>\n<p>A Taldan alchemist created the goldpebble with the ultimate goal of breeding a creature capable of reproducing at a high rate while possessing a body that would turn to gold upon death, effectively ensuring an endless supply of wealth. Initially, the experiments were successful, with each shed of the snake's skin producing trace amounts of gold. As the snakes grew, however, the amount of gold didn't, and the snakes themselves soon proved unwieldy and difficult to contain. Unhindered, the alchemist redoubled her efforts, adding alchemical reagents to her experiments and leaning more heavily into inhumane tactics to produce her desired results. These tactics failed to lead to an increase in the amount of gold produced but instead mutated the creatures' venom, giving them the ability to slowly turn a victim's blood to frozen water. Empowered with this new ability, the goldpebbles felled their own creator and escaped to spread across the Inner Sea region.</p>\n<p>Goldpebbles are generally solitary creatures except for their biannual mating season. During this time, they're even more dangerous than usual, becoming territorial and protective of their young while attacking in groups. Once the eggs hatch, the breeding grounds are filled with hundreds of tiny snakes slithering in all directions in search of new territory. These young goldpebbles are less in control of their alchemical powers than their adult counterparts and have the potential to freeze the water around them at a moment's notice.</p>\n<p>Goldpebbles rely heavily on ambush tactics. Often found hiding in shallow pools, rivers, and lakes, goldpebbles will lure unsuspecting adventurers to their lairs using their gold-flecked scales. Once within reach, goldpebbles attack with a gruesome bite that can poison an unlucky victim, slowly turning their prey's blood into freezing water. Goldpebbles can also chill the waters around them, making it incredibly difficult for prey to survive.</p>",

They can break through large slabs of ice and dive into frozen waters in search of prey.

Large prey—such as whales, caribou, or moose—offer the best sustenance, but they aren't picky when it's time to eat.</p>\n<p>Rime dragons have a deep curiosity for things hidden and lost in the ice. The ocean's currents bring all kinds of artifacts from across the world to their frigid waters. Self-described caretakers and scholars, rime dragons search the arctic regions for ancient antiquities. Rime dragons with an academic interest in archaeology peer into glaciers for pieces of civilizations both recent and ancient, which they preserve in their lairs. Others might search for fossils or preserved corpses. Rime dragons also have an interest in more biological aspects of the world. As preservers of life, some of these dragons collect flora to log and study, and they protect endangered species by using low temperatures to conserve them. They also act as paleopathologists, studying ancient diseases that could cause havoc if they were brought back to a populace unknowingly.

For those able to locate and gain the trust of such a creature, even the youngest sage dragons are fonts of difficult-to-find knowledge and rare magical techniques. The oldest sage dragons are living combinations of gargantuan libraries and endless grimoires, accumulating the secrets of the Universe, and beyond, in their isolated lairs.</p>\n<p>Organized and methodical, with an insatiable curiosity and eidetic memory, sage dragons are the devout researchers of the dragon world. The intellectual pursuits of sage dragons demand extended periods of quiet study, one of the reasons that such dragons live in isolated, hidden locations. Young dragons tend to specialize in a particular area of research. As they age, these research interests also broaden, with an expert in a particular river expanding into topics such as the water cycle, ecology, or the Plane of Water. Sage dragons interested in religious topics often worship Nethys or a god dedicated to knowledge, such as Gruhastha, Qi Zhong, or Ydajisk. Dragons who seek grim rituals or cryptic knowledge might join the church of Abraxas or worship Norgorber in his aspect of the Reaper of Reputation.</p>",

By way of logic, if there exist such environments and entities today, then earth dragons must exist too. Or have existed, once upon a primeval time.</p>\n<p>And yet among the imperial dragons today there are only sovereign dragons, who leave serpentine skeletons behind upon death in place of rock, stone, or land. The dragons' innate spellcasting, weakness to unheated iron, and other traits highly suggest that they're associated with elemental earth. The rest of their powers have little to no such association, instead centered on the mysteries of the metaphysical spirit and mind.</p>\n<p>There's no clear explanation for why sovereign dragons are the way they are today. Some guess it might have been a deal to fulfill personal ambition, to go from those tasked with selecting rulers to becoming the rulers themselves. Others wonder if the lands of Tian Xia were corrupted in the past, and the earth dragons walked away from their elemental natures to save themselves. Perhaps they too became empyreal dragons, but then returned to the lands of mortals when no suitable ruler rose to the throne.</p>",

They'll happily catch and eat octopuses, tidal fish, starfish, sea anemones, and seabirds if the opportunity arises. Their long, webbed claws make them nimble hunters and allow them to reach into rocky recesses.

They frequently steal brightly painted floats, flags, and shiny hooks to decorate their tidal caves. Prized pieces are reserved for ornamenting themselves, and they cover their scales with shards of glass, necklaces of coral, or crowns of silverware retrieved from wrecks.</p><hr /><p>Though dragonets are smaller and lacking the raw power of great dragons, they are every bit as varied and fascinating as their larger relatives. Like dragons, dragonets have strong ties to magic. These ties influence the contrasting natures exhibited by different dragonet types.

By contrast, pearl dragonets are gentle oddities that seem naturally friendly.</p>\n<p>Dragonets range in size from little bigger than songbirds to no larger than house cats. Unlike most great dragons, they stop growing after reaching maturity. They vary greatly in intelligence; fey dragonets are known for their tricks and wit, while feral racing drakes have the average problem solving capacity of a pigeon.

Thus, it doesn't take a bard to note that a bog dragon represents the most primal embodiment of their namesake. These dragons are as calm as the brackish waters, as perfectly patient as any crocodile mistaken for debris, and as ancient as any fear held of the realms they dwell within. To the many cultures they've stalked since the first humanoids dared to build their dwellings near brackish fens, a bog dragon is a terror consigned to the nebulous realm of monster and abomination. Though most have been relegated to the stuff of legends and the mythic nightmares of river valley city-states, bog dragons are still out there, lurking beneath the loam.</p>\n<p>Bog dragons haunt the parables of old, their primal characteristics a raw expression of a primeval world that rebukes the tyranny of time's progression. Their bodies are those of a belly-dragging thing, corpulent and richly shielded by a scabrous hide of spurs and spines. Their claws, much like their wings, are feeble things, vestiges of a more graceful draconic concept that only the eldest bog archdragon might attain. Their faces are masks of terror; their lips curl back in a snarl to expose brutish grins of dagger-like fangs, pock-marked by vicious stomach acids that give their latent breath the malodorous turpitude that stings the senses almost unto dizziness. They're every inch a night-going monstrosity, a harrowing horror that would drive terror into any who behold them, the pinnacle of marsh-born predators.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>Deep within the woods are grand, giant creatures with tusked maws. Their visages have inspired various tusked demon masks used for great festivals across Tian Xia. These beasts are known as aso berangs, or bear dogs, in the islands of Minata. As their name suggests, they resemble large canines with the bulk of a bear. However, aso berangs aren't simply large and charismatic animals, for many say they're the kings of forest spirits and patrons of guardians. They're often revered as protective entities by those who live outside the woods they guard. These guardians only appear to common folk if the forest they live in is in danger or if they need something. When they do so, aso berangs can appear as large and powerful humans who emanate a regal presence. Aso berangs have wickedly sharp talons that shed regularly, and they're strong enough to climb trees in pursuit of witches who attempt to escape up them. Very often, aso berangs attack visitors whose hearts they deem impure or those they consider as potential threats to their forest. Unfortunately, receiving this judgment usually takes little more than forgetting to perform the proper rites of respect and reverence.</p>",
