Your mark gains @Compendium[pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.sebk9XseMCRkDqRg]{Lifesense} (imprecise, 15 feet) in the form of your patron's watchful eye, which is the only means by which it can perceive others. Your mark gains a Perception DC and has a Perception modifier equal to your level plus your spellcasting modifier. Your mark can perceive things even when you normally couldn't, such as when you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Blinded]{Blinded}, @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Dazzled]{Dazzled}, or @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}. You can use your mark to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Seek]{Seek} if you spend an action to Interact with it, but it can only target the area around you. When a creature is detected by your mark, it alerts you to its presence and that creature becomes @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Hidden]{Hidden} to you instead of undetected or observed if the creature has no means to hide. If you are sleeping and your mark detects danger, it will automatically attempt to wake you at a @Check[type:perception|dc:5] each turn if it believes you are in danger. Over time, your mark learns the difference between your allies and other creatures, though it will still alert you to danger if it believes an ally is hostile.</p>"
