To\n    exact revenge on the despicable mogul who destroyed their lives, the party must hotfoot around the grime-caked\n    streets of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ooalk01player.JournalEntryPage.01alkenstarcit00]{Alkenstar, The City of Smog}. As\n    the Game Master, you'll construct a scaffolding of riveting non-player characters, intricate plots, and electrifying\n    encounters upon which your players can craft stories of their characters' thrilling exploits. As they explore a vast\n    city of clockwork menaces and explosive drama, the party will take down brass-clad constructs, blast through steel\n    vaults, and harness their reputations as hardened rebels to save the day.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Using this Adventure Path</h1>\n  <p>\n    The three volumes of the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path include everything necessary to run a complete\n    Pathfinder campaign for characters from 1st to 10th level. Together with the\n    <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> and supplemental rules in the Pathfinder Reference Document (available online at\n    <a href=\"https://paizo.com/prd\" style=\"font-weight: bold\">paizo.com/prd</a>), each volume contains everything\n    necessary for you as the Game Master to run the Adventure Path, including the adventure itself, articles to enhance\n    the campaign's setting, and the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17806advent.JournalEntryPage.06powderkegpar00]{Adventure Toolbox}, which features new character rules options and creatures that appear throughout the adventure.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To play in this campaign, each player should have a copy of the\n    <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> as well as the <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide</em>, a free supplement\n    downloadable from <strong>paizo.com.</strong>\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Background</h1>\n  <p>\n    Amid the tangle of pipes, smokestacks, and bricks that congest Alkenstar's grimy manufacturing districts,\n    innovations bubble up from inventors' laboratories, chemists' private factories, and gunsmiths' workshops. Most\n    developments fizzle out like so much effervescence or otherwise elude containment from even the city's most\n    brilliant minds. Sometimes, however, a single spark of genius is so explosive that it can change the fate of an\n    entire city.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Such is the case for the eccentric but brilliant alchemist Vashon Gattlebee and his latest invention, an extremely\n    volatile liquid he's dubbed “pyronite.” No mere firecracker, this new instrument of destruction rivals the most\n    powerful bombardments in terms of sheer catastrophic potential, yet its size is relatively diminutive; it can\n    contain a hundred cannons' worth of energy in a tube no larger than a goblin's forearm. Never before has such a\n    powerful explosive existed in such a compact form. It's no exaggeration to claim that Gattlebee's invention promises\n    to shake the foundations of the known world.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Gattlebee traces his interest in science and explosives back to a formidable childhood tragedy. When he was just a\n    boy, Gattlebee's father took him on a hunting trip in a relatively quiet region of the nearby Mana Wastes. Monsters,\n    bandits, and worse threatened the safety of Alkenstar, his father told him, so it would be important for Gattlebee\n    to know how to handle himself. On the second day of their expedition, their makeshift long-gun backfired, killing\n    Vashon's father instantly. Somehow, the boy made it back to Alkenstar in tattered, bloodstained clothes, but it took\n    many weeks before he could speak of what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Vashon never picked up a firearm or ventured beyond Alkenstar's walls again. He shut out the rest of the world and\n    entombed himself in his private quarters, where he read books, studied alchemy, and performed experiments from\n    sunrise late into the night. One might have expected the survivor of such a terrible accident to avoid munitions\n    altogether, but hardly a day passed without some contained explosion or planned calamity almost blasting Gattlebee's\n    closed door off its hinges. Few were surprised when, years later, young Gattlebee enrolled at Blythir College to\n    continue his scientific pursuits, vowing to someday develop a substance that would render gunpowder obsolete.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Chain Reaction</h2>\n  <p>\n    Gattlebee, now a middle-aged man, is one of Alkenstar's most famous recluses. He's regarded as a misunderstood\n    genius by his friends and a perfectly understood crackpot by his detractors. Years of quiet, patient work in front\n    of his alchemy bench have finally yielded an invention Gattlebee can be proud of—an explosive substance that he\n    believes could eventually replace traditional black powder and revolutionize technology as the world knows it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In its raw state, pyronite is a viscous semi-transparent gel prone to catastrophic combustion at the slightest bump.\n    Such volatile substances are not unknown on Golarion, but their unpredictable nature is exactly what makes such\n    concoctions so rare and unwieldy. Gattlebee's true breakthrough came when he discovered that he could stabilize the\n    chemical by mixing it with soda ash and a special type of white salt collected from the Spellscar Desert. Once it\n    was stabilized, Gattlebee could pack the pyronite compound into small paper spheres, cylinders, or boxes and\n    transport it with ease.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The alchemist recently presented his formula to the public for the first time at an exposition at his alma mater,\n    Alkenstar's esteemed Blythir College. Although he carefully determined the pyronite dosage for the demonstration—he\n    brought a pellet no larger than a pea—his calculations must have been off. What should've been a dose just large\n    enough to blow open an armoire-sized adamantine gun safe ended up leveling more than half of the college's largest\n    lecture hall. Miraculously, no one was harmed except for Gattlebee, who sustained a few scrapes and bruises while he\n    stoically looked over his bungled demo. To the nonplussed inventor, the minor wounds he suffered paled in comparison\n    to the disappointment of an experiment gone awry.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In spite of the botched exhibit (or perhaps because of it), the “pyronite incident” left a powerful impression on\n    all the students, faculty, and entrepreneurs who witnessed it. Invitations for high-paying jobs and speaking\n    engagements flooded in for Gattlebee, who was ill-prepared for the sudden spotlight. Overwhelmed by the attention,\n    he retreated to his private lab in Steamhaven. As he'd done so many times before in his life, Gattlebee shut and\n    locked the door behind him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Two of the demonstration's attendees weren't content to let Gattlebee slip back into the shadows. Ambrost Mugland, a\n    powerful private financier, realized right away the destructive (and lucrative) potential of pyronite in\n    construction, war, or whatever other ventures he could stick his hands in. The mogul deduced that two wealthy buyers\n    resided in Alkenstar's own backyard: the warring wizard nations on either side of the Duchy's borders. If Mugland\n    could pit the nations of Geb and Nex against one another in a bidding war over the pyronite formula—or secretly sell\n    it to both of them—then he stood to make a veritable killing from the deal.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The other attendee who set Gattlebee firmly in her sights was Foebe Dunsmith. Though she's known to most as the\n    popular yet insouciant owner of the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon, Dunsmith is, in fact, a high-ranking informant for\n    the Alkenstar government, and the pyronite showcase unsettled her to her core. Dunsmith informed Grand Duchess\n    Trietta Ricia of Gattlebee's invention and correctly speculated its potential to upend the already tenuous political\n    order in eastern Garund. Dunsmith knew that other Alkenstar power brokers, such as Mugland, would also have their\n    eyes on the pyronite formula and that any more public attention drawn to the matter would only complicate the\n    situation. So, with the grand duchess's blessing, Dunsmith set about looking for independent yet manipulatable\n    agents to help her secure the formula. Once the secrets of its creation were safe, Ricia could formulate a long-term\n    solution for pyronite's inevitable release into the wider world.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Clock's Ticking</h2>\n  <p>\n    To fulfill his scheme of stealing the pyronite formula, Ambrost Mugland has had to pull strings and call in favors\n    all across Alkenstar. The mogul has even gone into debt over the matter—an unconventional tack for the notorious\n    copper-pincher—so convinced is he that this all-in bet on pyronite will pay off.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Mugland's most expensive, but by far most useful, accomplice thus far has been a corrupt officer of the law, Deputy\n    Shieldmarshal Anjelique Loveless. Loveless has likewise committed everything she has to the pyronite plot; she cowed\n    dozens of low-ranking shieldmarshals into subservience, and she has called in favors with criminal gangs all around\n    Alkenstar. Her minions have dutifully killed off anyone Mugland or Loveless suspected of potentially upsetting their\n    schemes, even other Alkenstar elites who attended Gattlebee's exposition. Of course, the lowly saloon owner Foebe\n    Dunsmith, among others, fell far beneath Mugland's or Loveless's notices.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Mugland has already secured buyers for the formula: two revolutionaries from across Alkenstar's borders named Parsus\n    (a ghoulish necromancer from Geb) and Ibrium (a suave Nexian geomancer). Despite hailing from nations famously at\n    odds with one another, the two buyers seem to be working together. Mugland doesn't care about the details of their\n    plans for pyronite, though; he just needs to deliver the goods so he can get paid. Unfortunately for the would-be\n    weapons dealer, he hasn't been able to capture Gattlebee or the pyronite formula because the reclusive alchemist\n    hasn't left his home since the Blythir exposition. Breaking and entering might work, but Gattlebee is famously\n    unpredictable, and Mugland doesn't want to risk the alchemist accidentally blowing up his own lab (and, more\n    importantly, the pyronite formula) in an act of self-defense. Mugland has no choice, for now, but to simply wait for\n    Gattlebee to emerge from his domestic fortress.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Foebe Dunsmith and Grand Duchess Ricia also understand that this waiting game can't last forever, and they've caught\n    wind of Mugland's plot. The sooner they get Gattlebee and his formula to a safe, hidden location, the sooner they\n    can rest assured that pyronite won't fall into the wrong hands. Dunsmith needs to find some trustworthy\n    mercenaries—preferably ones who can keep a low profile, are blissfully unaware of the pyronite matter, and don't\n    mind rubbing elbows with some of Alkenstar's less-reputable power brokers—to get Gattlebee to safety. For this task,\n    she's applying a classic Alkenstar axiom: “A bullet for my enemy aims as true in any gun.”\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Volatile Situation</h2>\n  <p>\n    Dunsmith has selected a handful of rough-and-tumble outlaws who each bear a personal grudge against Ambrost Mugland\n    or Deputy Loveless. To see if these toughs can work together in pursuit of their shared revenge, she has organized a\n    heist targeting the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17802reachf.JournalEntryPage.02goldtankrese00]{Gold Tank Reserve}, one\n    of Mugland's smallest investment operations. The firm caters primarily to small-time, white-collar crooks and\n    landowners who live off the sweat of others' brows by targeting ranchers, small businesses, and other vulnerable\n    Alkenstar citizens with high-interest loans and exploitative contracts. Taking down the enterprise wouldn't solve\n    everyone's problems right away, but it would send a definitive message to Mugland and those who support him. If\n    Dunsmith's mercenaries can pull off this bank job, she plans to involve them in her and the duchess's scheme to\n    secure Gattlebee and take down Mugland.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Robbing the Gold Tank won't be so easy, however. Mugland's associate, Deputy Loveless, has caught wind of the\n    party's plans and hopes to intercept the thieves along their getaway route. She and her fellow crooked\n    shieldmarshals aren't known for offering mercy or playing fair—in fact, they look forward to the opportunity to dole\n    out their own brand of cruel, wicked justice away from public eyes.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide</h1>\n  <p>\n    Before running this Adventure Path, provide your players with copies of the\n    <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide</em>, a free download from\n    <a href=\"https://paizo.com/\" style=\"font-weight: bold\">www.paizo.com</a>.

Their pursuit for revenge\n    ultimately puts them in the best position possible to save the city of Alkenstar from utter catastrophe. The Outlaws\n    of Alkenstar Adventure Path spans three volumes and takes player characters from 1st through 10th level.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Punks in a Powderkeg</h2>\n  <p><strong>By Vanessa Hoskins</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Path #178, Levels 1–3</strong></p>\n  <p>\n    To impress a mysterious patron who promises to help them get revenge against their rivals, the characters rob\n    Ambrost Mugland's illicit banking operation, the\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17802reachf.JournalEntryPage.02goldtankrese00]{Gold Tank Reserve}. Afterward, the humble\n    bartender Foebe Dunsmith reveals that she's actually an informant for Alkenstar's grand duchess. She then gives the\n    mercenaries their next mission: protect the famous alchemist Vashon Gattlebee from kidnappers while escorting him\n    across the city to safety.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Two street gangs waylay the party and attempt to abscond with Gattlebee. The Clearwater Cleaners are obviously\n    working for Mugland, but the Powderkeg Punks' motives are a mystery. After they get Gattlebee to a safehouse, the\n    characters' investigation reveals that Gattlebee's small-time rival, Shoma Lyzerius, paid the Punks to apprehend\n    Gattlebee. To put a stop to the renegade alchemist's schemes, the characters track down Lyzerius in the ramshackle\n    district of Hellside.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Cradle of Quartz</h2>\n  <p><strong>By Scott D. Young</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Path #179, Levels 4–7</strong></p>\n  <p>\n    Foebe Dunsmith hires the characters to locate a priest of Brigh named Olomon Kosowana, who has somehow\n    reverse-engineered the dangerous explosive called pyronite. When they get to Kosowana's home, they find the priest's\n    clockwork laboratory already ransacked. Fortunately, Kosowana had enough time to leave a clue for the characters to\n    track him down at the Cradle of Quartz, a remote shrine to Brigh in the middle of the Spellscar Desert.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After arranging for an ill-fated airship journey to the desert and surviving the wasteland's strange cosmic horrors,\n    the characters rescue Kosowana from the malevolent inhabitants of the Cradle of Quartz. The outlaws then learn from\n    the priest that their rival, Ambrost Mugland, has gotten hold of Kosowana's recipe for pyronite and that he hired a\n    gang called the Gilded Gunners to test it at the Steaming Kingdom, a rival business owner's exclusive speakeasy. The\n    characters stop the assault then use their clues to finally track down Mugland and get their revenge once and for\n    all. Before his fate is sealed, Mugland reveals that he has already sold the formula to a pair of renegades from\n    Alkenstar's neighboring nations.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">The Smoking Gun</h2>\n  <p><strong>By Cole Kronewitter</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Path #180, Levels 8–10</strong></p>\n  <p>\n    Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia herself approaches the characters and explains that the pyronite situation has become\n    dire. Unless the party can locate Deputy Loveless and Mugland's pyronite buyers before they use the bombs, the\n    safety of all of Alkenstar is threatened. The outlaws' best lead takes them to the Gunworks far west of Alkenstar,\n    where they learn more about the pyronite buyers—a necromancer from Geb named Parsus and a Nexian geomancer named\n    Ibrium—and their potential plot to level Alken Falls using pyronite.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The outlaws infiltrate the Tinwound Hydroforge at Alken Falls, where Parsus has used necromantic powers to fill the\n    water purification plant with undead minions. The necromancer has cleared the place for Ibrium and Loveless to load\n    it full of pyronite. Once defeated, Parsus explains that Ibrium and Loveless are on an inbound luxury riverboat,\n    pyronite in hand.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To save the day, the outlaws board a casino boat called\n    <em>The Gearsmoke</em> as it cruises down the Ustradi River. They sneak about the vessel to disarm the pyronite and\n    defeat Deputy Loveless and Ibrium, upending the villains' plot once and for all.\n  </p>\n</div>\n"

Once they’re finally safe at the Barrel &amp; Bullet saloon, the characters learn\n    Dunsmith is, in fact, an informant for the grand duchess, and she wants their help to take down Mugland and his\n    cronies for good.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span>Chapter 2: Run and Gun</span></h2>\n  <p>\n    Dunsmith asks the characters to escort renowned alchemist Vashon Gattlebee, the inventor of a volatile explosive\n    called pyronite, across the city. The outlaws will need to protect their genius charge from a variety of assassins,\n    including two violent street gangs, as they wind their way through Alkenstar and back to the Barrel &amp; Bullet\n    Saloon.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span>Chapter 3: Turn the Screws</span></h2>\n  <p>\n    Dunsmith asks the party to track down whoever hired the Powderkeg Punks, one of the gangs who attempted to kidnap\n    Gattlebee. By sleuthing around Alkenstar and meeting with the Powderkeg Punks’ tempestuous leader, the outlaws\n    eventually discover the culprit is an ifrit alchemist named\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17806advent.JournalEntryPage.06shomalyzeriu00]{Shoma Lyzerius}, a jealous rival of\n    Gattlebee’s. Lyzerius is hiding out in Alkenstar’s ramshackle cliff-face neighborhood Hellside. Once the party has\n    apprehended him, Lyzerius reveals that the secret formula for pyronite is no longer a secret at all. Clearly, the\n    party’s work has just begun.\n  </p>\n  <section class=\"advancement-track\">\n    <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Advancement Track</h1>\n    <p>“Punks in a Powderkeg” is designed for four characters.

To evade capture at the hands of the corrupt shieldmarshals who work for Mugland’s ally,\n    Deputy Anjelique Loveless, the party must race to the nearby Wailing Scrapyard. Only by surviving the hazards and\n    monsters of this massive junkyard can the party hope to reach safety back at the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon.\n  </p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Magic in Alkenstar</h1>\n  <p>\n    The so-called City of Smog lies in the heart of the Mana Wastes, a fickle wasteland desert where magic doesn’t\n    always function as planned. In Outlaws of Alkenstar, the unpredictable nature of magic is presented during several\n    set encounters—particularly in the Mana Wastes in the second and third volumes—and characters are made aware in\n    advance whenever such circumstances might arise. For the most part, however, magic works normally in nearly every\n    encounter. If you and your group are interested in making unreliable magic a larger part of your campaign, consider\n    using the rules for wellspring magic (<em>Pathfinder Secrets of Magic</em> 248) or leaning into the concepts of\n    Bronzetime and Surgetime while in Alkenstar (sidebar on page 51).\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<p>\n  As the nearly endless arcane wars between the nations of Nex and Geb devastated the very land itself, magic became\n  unreliable within the realm of the wizards’ conflict. It became a vast, ravaged desert named the Mana Wastes. Few now\n  tread there on purpose, for the creatures that have survived in the wasteland are bizarre and powerful. Yet amid this\n  dusty cradle, a settlement of inventors, alchemists, and survivalists constructed a haven for their unorthodox ideas\n  and creations. They developed technology to rival the most powerful spellcasters by harnessing clockwork, primordial\n  steam engines, black powder, and the secrets of alchemy.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Now, in the soot-covered city of Alkenstar, the largest settlement in the Mana Wastes, industry and innovation\n  continue to abound. The wealthy citizens of Skyside harness the erratic but potent magical energies all around them to\n  create colossal constructs, mighty horrors of wood and iron, and weapons of dire portent. Meanwhile, in the\n  smog-shrouded neighborhoods of Smokeside, gunsmiths forge firearms of exquisite beauty, toxic ammunition that defies\n  logic, and armor capable of withstanding the gruesome armaments. Throughout the entire city, inspiration and\n  innovation fuel a vast industry of thunderous technology, explosive discoveries, and cataclysmic powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The race for finding the strongest weapon creates fierce competition between factions both legitimate and illicit.\n  Power shifts to whomever claims control over the newest innovation, and patrons are willing to pay top dollar for\n  inventors able to produce results. Occasionally, an inventor or alchemist devises something so dangerous and volatile,\n  it threatens to topple the balance of power completely.\n</p>\n<p>This is one of those moments.</p>\n<p>\n  The genius inventor Vashon Gattlebee recently demonstrated the destructive power of his latest invention, a potent new\n  form of explosive called pyronite. Alkenstar’s greatest minds are abuzz with the potential applications for this\n  fascinating new technology, from terraforming to warfare. Gattlebee has thus far refused to sell his invention or\n  share its secrets with any of the many potential patrons who now court him, but there are powers at play who simply\n  won’t take no for an answer.\n</p>\n<p>\n  While nobles and weapons dealers strive for a contract with Gattlebee, the ruler of Alkenstar, Grand Duchess Trietta\n  Ricia, is trying to stop the invention’s spread before it’s too late. She knows a power like this threatens to shake\n  the foundations of Garund, perhaps all Golarion, if it falls into the wrong hands. One such pair of hands belongs to\n  Ambrost Mugland, a ruthless financier who would gladly sell the formula to both Nex and Geb, hoping to double his\n  profits. With the aid of his right-hand ally, the infamously corrupt shieldmarshal Deputy Anjelique Loveless,\n  Mugland’s schemes spell doom for both neighboring nations—to say nothing of the city caught in the crossfire.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Though the grand duchess can’t act directly without politically dirtying her hands, she can work through an agent.\n  She’s asked Foebe Dunsmith, a local saloon owner and staunch ally, to arrange for the protection of Gattlebee and to\n  keep a lid on his formula. Dunsmith has just the crew in mind: a band of outlaws who have little love for Ambrost\n  Mugland or Deputy Loveless, but she needs to test their mettle first—and earn some silver while she’s at it.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In “Punks in a Powderkeg,” the characters learn about the looming threat of pyronite and work for Alkenstar’s\n  government to keep the secret formula out of the wrong hands.\n</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Getting Started</h1>\n<p>\n  The characters begin this adventure in the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon. They’ve all been lured here by Foebe Dunsmith,\n  the smooth-talking, gun-slinging proprietor who’s promised to help the party get revenge on their mutual enemies.\n  Players can find specific hooks and backgrounds to tie their characters into this Adventure Path—including a reason\n  why they’ve shown up at the saloon tonight—in the free\n  <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ooalk01player.JournalEntryPage.01howtousethis00]{Player’s Guide}</em> supplement on\n  <a href=\"https://paizo.com\" style=\"font-weight: bold\">paizo.com</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n  With her help, Dunsmith has promised the characters they can hit Ambrost Mugland where it hurts him most—the wallet.\n  She’s invited the party to the bar tonight to enjoy this week’s episode in a serial of plays titled\n  <em>Hearts at High Noon</em>. After the show, she’ll gather the outlaws in one of the saloon’s back rooms where they\n  can discuss the details of the job she has to offer them.\n</p>\n<p>\n  When you’re ready to start the adventure, read or paraphrase the following text aloud to set the scene and give the\n  players an opportunity to introduce their characters to one another. Alternatively, you could start the characters on\n  the steps of the Gold Tank Reserve and have each of them\n</p>\n<p>reflect on the circumstances of getting this job using a flashback (see the Straight to the Action sidebar).</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Straight to the Action</h1>\n  <p>\n    Especially for new players, the free-form nature of this adventure’s opening scene can be quite intimidating.\n    Players might overthink their plan or get overwhelmed by the sheer number of possibilities open to them. If you\n    think your group would benefit from cutting straight to the action, consider simply starting the adventure right in\n    front of the Gold Tank Reserve instead. In this case, you can still give the party an opportunity to discuss their\n    mission with Dunsmith—simply present this conversation as a brief flashback.\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “Draw.” Bang! A crack of thunder fills the air. The smoking gun, held by a powerfully built orc man wearing leather\n    chaps, vest, and a shiny sheriff’s badge, holds everyone’s attention. The orc slowly lowers the firearm, stowing it\n    back in his holster. He carefully and deliberately walks up to a bloody dwarf, surveying his handiwork.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “I’m sorry it had to go down this way, brother. You picked the wrong side and that I can’t abide.” He removes his\n    pinched-front hat, holding it over his heart. After a moment, he lowers his head.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The entire saloon erupts in applause as the pianist begins to play. The orc bows deeply, then helps the dwarf to his\n    feet, who also bows to the attending patrons. The two walk to the bar, arm in arm, and order a bottle of whiskey.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “Thank you for attending!” A female dwarf stands on the bar top, addressing the patrons in a loud voice. “Whiskey is\n    only two silver for the next hour, and that includes top shelf. Come back next week for the conclusion of Hearts at\n    High Noon and our after-party! Enjoy yourselves!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The dwarven woman, Foebe Dunsmith, hops off the bar onto the sawdust-covered floor and heads to a back room, where a\n    round table and private bar await. She props one foot up on a stool, leans forward on her knee, and casts a\n    suspicious eye around the room. “Now that the show is over, let’s talk business. I brought you all here because we\n    share some common enemies. With your help, I can make them pay—and get you rich in the process. But first, I want\n    you to tell me why you deserve a job that could pay your weight in gold.”\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Ask each of your players to introduce their characters to the rest of the group. Players can share as much or little\n  as they like about their characters, including the backgrounds they may have selected from the\n  <em>Outlaws of Alkenstar Player’s Guide</em>. One thing every character should have in common is a grudge held toward\n  either the cutthroat mogul Ambrost Mugland or the corrupt shieldmarshal Deputy Anjelique Loveless.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once the characters have been introduced, Dunsmith offers to pour a round of drinks and calls for food. She then\n  explains why she’s brought them all here today: to pull off a robbery at one of Mugland’s banks.\n</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n  <p>\n    “Here’s the game,” Dunsmith says. “Ambrost Mugland has a decent portion of his funds invested in an old bank called\n    the Gold Tank Reserve. It’s a rundown temple of Abadar in Ironside Quarter that’s mostly used by ranchers and\n    crooked politicians. I happen to know they’ve sent half their clockwork handlers out for maintenance and won’t have\n    them back until tomorrow afternoon.

Once you’re done inside the bank, run out the back.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “Mugland’s got a few crooked shieldmarshals on his payroll—including that damn bastard, Deputy Loveless. She and her\n    goons are sure to be hot on your tail, but don’t fight ‘em: they’ll gun you down in a second if you give them the\n    chance. Just run away and they’ll look like fools. Nothing’s sure to fry the deputy’s egg like crooks she can’t\n    catch, trust me. You can lose them in the Wailing Scrapyard just west of the Reserve.

Any questions?”\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  The characters can ask Dunsmith for more details about the job, working out any doubts or details of their plan.

I keep the rest to cover costs and fund the next part of our plan\n  to take down Mugland.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Will there be innocent people in the bank? </strong>“When it comes to Mugland’s businesses, nobody’s innocent.\n  That said, best to not go killing anybody or taking hostages. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t mind taking his\n  ‘investors’ down a notch too, but I can’t abide working with a crew of marauders as wicked as the devil himself.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What’s the next part of the plan to take down Mugland/Loveless? </strong>“First, I have to know I can trust\n  you. Let’s just do this job and we’ll get to the next.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you have against Mugland?</strong> “Besides him being a greedy son-of-a-gun who doesn’t care who he\n  steps on? Oh, I’ve got plenty of my own reasons.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How are we supposed to get in the vault?</strong> “It should be open during business hours. The inside gate’ll\n  be locked, but the bank manager, a Mugland crony named Dresh, has the keys.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How do we get into the bank?</strong> “Through the front door, I’d reckon. If you could get a key from one of\n  the staff, you could even go in the back. There’s an employee entrance in the alley that connects to the junkyard.\n  That’s how you make your escape.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>How many clockwork handlers should we expect?</strong> “Usually there’s half a dozen clockworks, Baalkirk\n  Model C-47s. But most of them are out on maintenance, so get in there before tomorrow afternoon, before they’re\n  returned.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Who is Deputy Loveless?</strong> “A crooked officer; she’s in Mugland’s pocket and does his dirty work, all in\n  the name of the law. If you see a half-elf with blue-black hair and death in her eyes, run. She’s a crack shot with a\n  bad attitude—she don’t miss and she don’t leave witnesses.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What can you tell us about the Wailing Scrapyard?</strong> Dunsmith shrugs. “Haunted,” she says before\n  throwing back the remainder of her whiskey.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What do you mean “haunted?!”</strong> “Look, there’s a rumor it’s haunted. It’s probably just the\n  Nailgobblers, though. They live in the heaps. If you need to resupply while you’re there, you can probably trade with\n  them—they’re friendly enough. But if they offer you anything to eat, don’t look at it too closely. Just hold your nose\n  and swallow.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What should we expect in the sewer?</strong> “Sewer’ll be the least of your worries. Get a map from the\n  Nailgobblers and you’ll be back here sippin’ whiskey with me.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once the characters have asked all their questions, Dunsmith gives them a\n  <em>Bag of Holding (Type I)</em>, which they can use to stow the\n  stolen gold, plus a <em>Hat of Disguise</em> for each character.\n  “Here’s a few things you might be able to use. Keep the pouch and put all of the gold in it, you hear? Otherwise it’ll\n  slow you down. Put on the hats so you can keep your identities secret, but don’t muss ‘em up—I’ll be wanting them back\n  when you’re done.” Thereafter, she excuses herself from the table and heads back to the saloon, leaving the characters\n  alone to plot their mission.

This gives them a chance to case the area, ask around about the bank or scrapyard, or perform\n  other preparations. Each of these activities takes roughly 2 hours to complete and there’s only 12 hours until the\n  bank opens the next morning, which is the last opportunity the characters have to execute the robbery.

A single outlet to the north has two doors: an inner door with iron bars and a massive outer door made of solid\n  steel.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The steel cabinets lining the walls are safety deposit boxes; they’re locked with the manager’s key and a key\n  belonging to a client. The characters don’t have time to linger here and try to break into each safety deposit box—if\n  a character insists on doing so, they find [[/r 3d12 #Silver Pieces]]{3d12}\n  @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.5Ew82vBF9YfaiY9f]{Silver Pieces} and a worthless memento of your own creation, such as\n  a brass ring, framed portrait, or silk handkerchief.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The massive vault door is 10 feet tall, matching the height of the vault.

The teller inserts their key into the vault door while Dresh turns\n  the combination lock in the correct order.

If\n  the characters want to try to break into the bank at night, they’ll have this massive door (and likely the Gold Tank\n  brokers’ deafening sirens) to contend with.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The inner iron bar door is a simple lock that can be undone with the manager’s key.

Grief\n  destroyed the other sister, who wandered off into the Mana Wastes, never to be seen again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since its abandonment, inventors and manufacturers around Alkenstar have continued to use the Smithsong Scrapyard as a\n  dumping ground for their failed experiments and destroyed constructs, creating towering heaps of discarded materials.\n  Before long, a small society of goblins who called themselves Nailgobblers moved into the neglected yard and began to\n  organize the scrap. They cleaned what they could and started selling it back to the citizens of Alkenstar to purchase\n  food, clean water, and other supplies they couldn't salvage.\n</p>\n<p>\n  For many years the Nailgobblers have been relatively successful—they've learned which parts of the yard to avoid and\n  which still have valuable materials to gather. Other scavengers or treasure hunters have attempted to drive the\n  Nailgobblers away, but so far with little success. To deter would-be usurpers from destroying their metaphorical\n  kingdom of trash, they use traps and scare tactics to drive away longshanks and other troublemakers. To pull off their\n  most famous and successful ruse, the Nailgobblers use a crank-box device to make their voices sound loud and hollow.\n  The resulting stories of wailing ghosts and mechanical spirits have given the scrapyard its current moniker, “the\n  Wailing Scrapyard,” along with an dangerous reputation that deters anyone with an ounce of sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Recently, a pack of monstrous gnolls calling themselves the Sludgespines have made their camp in the scrapyard, using\n  the junk piles as a hideout from which to kidnap locals and murder them for sport. The Nailgobblers are attempting to\n  drive these killers out of the Wailing Scrapyard, but the best they've been able to manage so far is making the\n  scrapyard difficult to traverse by setting up blockades to keep the gnolls contained.

He took\n        power after the last leader perished demonstrating his own invention (a steam-powered backpack designed to grant its\n        wearer flight, which promptly exploded during its first test run). He was dubbed Lord Glass after he incorporated\n        several pieces of multi-colored glass into his large overcoat, making him gleam like a rainbow chandelier. He wears\n        a dirty, oil-stained mat of fur that looks like a beard, which he believes makes him look distinguished.\n      </p>\n  </section>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Glass’s Quest:</strong> The Nailgobblers are in distress and need the characters’ help. Ever since the\n    Sludgespine killers showed up, they’ve had their entire way of life threatened. A few days ago, they sent an envoy\n    named Pogi into Alkenstar proper to hire mercenaries, and they assume the characters must be these mercenaries.\n  </p>\n  <p>When the characters meet with Lord Glass, read or paraphrase the following.</p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">\n    “Trusted longshanks,” intones Lord Glass, the bedazzled leader of the scavengers, in stilted Common. “We welcome you\n    to Scrap City and accept your offer of help.” He bows deeply but, weighed down by the countless shards of colored\n    glass lining his clothes, nearly loses his balance and falls off his stack of milk crates. He gathers himself and\n    clears his throat. “As promised, if you drive the gnolls away, we promise to give you our best junk. We have a\n    deal?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The characters have a chance to talk with Lord Glass, clearing up what the Nailgobblers want and gleaning some\n    information about the scrapyard and its denizens. Below are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and Lord\n    Glass’s responses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What do you want us to do?</strong> Lord Glass eyes you uncertainly, perplexed. He annunciates each word as\n    he slowly replies, “Make. Gnolls. Go. Away... We. Give. You. Gift.” He turns to a nearby goblin and loudly whispers,\n    “I didn’t expect smart mercenaries, but did Pogi find ones who can’t even remember what we hired them for?”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Why do you think we know this already? </strong>“Huh? Didn’t Pogi send you? We sent our envoy into the city\n    days ago to find mercenaries to take out the gnolls. We thought Pogi was so successful, you beat him here.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What can you tell us about these gnolls? </strong>“They come to our scrapyard and attack us. They attack\n    longshanks, too. The shieldmarshals think we attack longshanks, accuse us of killing them. But why would we kill\n    when we have so much good scrap around? Makes no sense. All to say: These murderers are bad for business.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Where are the gnolls?</strong> “North, over the wall. We put up sharp metal to keep them out, blocked their\n    way with the old ship, the big metal box. We shut them out, but they’re still there. Go, make them gone! The easiest\n    way for longshanks to get there is to go east, around the big metal box and the old ship.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What do we get for defeating the gnolls? </strong>“Best junk—secret junk we don’t usually sell to\n    longshanks. Rare metal.” Lord Glass smiles wide, his teeth chipped and sharp.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What’s this about an old ship? </strong>“Big flying ship.” Lord Glass says, gesturing in a sweeping overhead\n    motion. “Crashed here long ago. We used the crane to knock it down, block the gnolls. Heard a loud scream when we\n    pushed it down. Must have old captain inside... or a ghost.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What’s this about a metal box?</strong> “Big metal container. We used the crane to move it, block the path.\n    The gnolls can’t get past it—too heavy, too smooth to climb.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What about a crane?</strong> “Big old crane, to the east. Move the levers, the crane moves around the\n    scrapyard. Monsie knows how to fix it when it breaks down. Monsie’s smart, only Nailgobbler who knows how to fix\n    things like that.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What can you tell us about the scrapyard? </strong>“Scrap City is our home,” Lord Glass says proudly. The\n    other goblins bow their heads, their hearts full of pride. “Lots of junk to sell, lots of bugs to eat. Lots of rust,\n    too—Monsie knows how to make a tasty drink with the rust. We miss Monsie. She went to fight the gnolls but hasn’t\n    come back. Let us know if you see Monsie.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Is the scrapyard really haunted?</strong> “Ha! No. We make sounds to scare off longshanks who want our junk.\n    But also, yes. We heard a ghost once. That was how we got the idea to scare off longshanks.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Who is Monsie?</strong> “She’s the smartest Nailgobbler of all, an inventor. She makes lots of things:\n    bombs, yummy drinks, tools, foot crank for the fire pit. She went to fight the gnolls but hasn’t come back. We fear\n    the worst. Please find her. Please tell us she’s okay. We miss Monsie.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After the characters have concluded their conversation with Lord Glass, he offers them room and board in the\n    Nailgobblers’ encampment should they need to rest. Most of the food consists of vermin trapped and then cooked or\n    pickled—smoked rat, pickled rat, and deep-fried cockroaches. This is an appropriate place for the characters to take\n    an 8-hour rest if they need to.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award and Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.rs9ZLOXfLkadx27g]{Lord Glass' Reward}</p>\n    <p>If the characters drive away the gnolls in areas @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17802reachf.JournalEntryPage.02sludgespinec00]{B8} and\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17802reachf.JournalEntryPage.02sewerentranc00]{B10}, they can return to Lord Glass for a reward.

She’s a cold-blooded killer firmly embedded in Mugland’s pocket.

Don’t worry, you can lay\n    low here for a few days ‘til it all blows over.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>When do we get our next job?</strong> “Hungry for more, eh?

We can start in four days, or sooner if you’re able.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the characters are done asking Dunsmith questions, read or paraphrase the following aloud to conclude this\n    chapter with a startling revelation about their employer.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"read-aloud\">\n    <p>\n      Dunsmith swirls the dregs of her whiskey in her glass, downs the drink, and stands. She unholsters her shotgun in\n      one fluid motion, then sets the firearm on the bar counter. “Well now,” she says in a low voice. “I suddenly have\n      a lot of dirt on each of you, don’t I? Armed robbery, obstruction of justice, evading the law. Quite a rap sheet.”\n      She leans against the bar and stretches casually. “I guess this means I should tell you something about me. I’m\n      not just a saloon owner, for starters.” She removes her holster and sets it on the bar next to her shotgun. “In\n      fact, I work for a very powerful person, someone you’re no doubt familiar with.” She puts one hand in her vest,\n      palms something, and extends her closed hand. It’s a small signet ring that exhibits the distinctive symbol of the\n      Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. “Does Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia ring a bell? Yeah, I thought so.” Dunsmith can hardly\n      contain her smirk, enthralled with her own theatrics. “What this means is,” she sighs, drawing out the words,\n      “since you work for me, you actually work for the grand duchess.” She laughs, her cool façade finally cracking,\n      then slips the ring back into her pocket.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “What?

She’s animated and enthusiastic, clearly firing on all cylinders\n      and still reveling in the success of the Gold Tank Reserve heist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “For this next job,” Dunsmith says, “the duchess has asked us to secure\n      some very precious cargo.” She slides a broadsheet across the table: a\n      poster advertising “Vashon Gattlebee’s Pyronite Exhibition” at Blythir\n      College. The poster includes a woodprint of a harried human man in his\n      fifties—presumably Gattlebee—and some hyperbolic copy promoting the\n      “once-in-a-lifetime explosive showcase.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “I’m sure you’ve all heard of Gattlebee and his pyronite, yeah?” Dunsmith\n      asks. “Talk of the town ever since he leveled half of Blythir’s largest\n      auditorium. Well, Gattlebee’s invention has gotten him a lot of admirers\n      recently. Everyone in Alkenstar wants a piece of the man, or at least a\n      piece of his new invention. Thankfully for us, Gattlebee’s turned down\n      everyone who’s offered to hire him on or buy the pyronite formula from\n      him. He’s been able to hold off his prospectors from the safety of his own\n      home so far, but he can’t hold down that puny brick-and-mortar fortress\n      forever.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Fortunately, the grand duchess and I have managed to convince Gattlebee\n      he’d be better off here, in the saloon’s workshop, where no one will know\n      his location. He’s game, and now we just need to get him from point A to\n      point B.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “That’s where you come in. We need you to meet Gattlebee at his home on\n      the other side of the city and bring him back to the Barrel &amp; Bullet.\n      Once he’s here, I can keep him safe. Simple enough job, right? Go get\n      Gattlebee and bring him back here. I’m paying you fifty gold apiece to\n      bring him back in one piece.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Dunsmith pinches the bridge of her nose like she’s just remembered\n      something unpleasant. “Oh yeah. As part of our arrangement, Gattlebee made\n      us promise that he’d be able to make a stop along the way here. Near\n      Ironside Quarter at some abandoned brewery. Got me why, but that’s the\n      deal: stop at a place called ‘Yeast of All Brewery’ once you’ve got\n      Gattlebee. Besides, it might be a good place to lay low if you need to\n      catch your breath.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Anyway. We don’t have much time to get this done. Mugland and Loveless\n      are likely to make a grab for Gattlebee soon. Mugland’s been moving money\n      around and paying off some shady folk. By my estimations, we have about\n      four days to get to Gattlebee before our cargo is compromised.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Be ready for Mugland’s mercenaries, Loveless’s street gangs, or anyone\n      else under our rivals’ thumbs.” Dunsmith pulls a rolled-up map of\n      Alkenstar from a nearby shelf and unfurls it across table. “You should\n      scout your route before you pick up Gattlebee, just to make sure it’s\n      safe.” She then removes her cameo brooch and sets it on top of the map.\n      “Show this to Gattlebee so he knows you’re working for me.”\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    Give your players a blank copy of the map of Alkenstar on the inside back\n    cover of this volume.

Following are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and\n    Dunsmith’s responses.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Why do you work for Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia? </strong>“We go\n    back a long time. Before she was even in politics, if you can believe it.\n    Anyway, I do her a lot of favors. It’s no secret among rulers that you can’t\n    accomplish everything with decrees and signatures and tariffs. Sometimes,\n    you need someone to get their hands dirty on the ground floor. That’s where\n    I—and now you—come in.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What if I don’t want to work for the grand duchess?</strong> “Just\n    consider it working for me. Look, this is going to ruin all of Mugland’s\n    plans. You want to ruin him good? You want to take this job.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>How will this help us get revenge on Mugland/Loveless? </strong>“Mugland and Loveless desperately want the formula for pyronite, no doubt\n    for some shady back room deal they’re hoping to make. So far, they haven’t\n    left a shred of evidence about their plans, but it’s only a matter of time\n    until they slip up. When that happens, you’ll have your chance to make\n    things right, whatever that means to you. In the meantime, we’ve got to make\n    sure\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    neither of them achieves their goals, which is why we have to get Gattlebee\n    to safety.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What’s the big deal with pyronite?</strong>\n    <strong>Why does Mugland want it?</strong> “Clearly, you didn’t see the\n    demonstration. Gattlebee blew up an entire building, practically, with a\n    dose of the stuff no bigger than a musket ball. Everyone wants to get a\n    piece of it—for war, industry, you name it. Mugland is a businessman, so his\n    interests are purely financial. He intends to sell it, that much is certain.\n    We’re just not sure to whom.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>What does the grand duchess of Alkenstar want with pyronite?</strong>\n    “Honestly? To bury it. Having that stuff out in the world is just too\n    dangerous. If it falls into the wrong hands, a whole lot of people are going\n    to get hurt. Gattlebee’s been too wrapped up in the work itself to see how\n    much potential his invention has to destroy lives. Thankfully, that’s the\n    same reason why he hasn’t sold it; he cares more about getting pyronite\n    right than making a profit.

Bit of a shut-in recently, of\n    course, and he’s whip-smart when it comes to keeping intruders out of his\n    home, so watch your step. He knows about our arrangement to get him to\n    safety, but he’s always neck-deep in his work, and he forgets just about\n    anything that isn’t written in his formula book. Don’t be surprised if the\n    door’s locked when you get there. Shoot, he might not even remember it’s the\n    day you’re coming!”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Any recommendations on how to get him back here?</strong> “You\n    should scout your route between Steamhaven and Ferrous Quarter before you\n    pick up the cargo. There’s no good sewer access between here and there, so\n    you’ll have to bring him overland, through the city. You’ll run into\n    trouble, no doubt about it—goons hired by Mugland, for sure. You should be\n    able to catch your breath at Yeast of All Brewery before completing the\n    final leg of the trip.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the characters have finished asking Dunsmith questions, she wishes them\n    luck and returns to tending bar.

Gattlebee pinches the bridge of his nose, exasperated. “Ah, bolts. Slick’s gotten\n    into the growth serum again. You see the shrink potion anywhere? Never mind; what am I asking you for? Just take\n    care of this.

Calming the chameleon without harming him is no simple task.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Hazard: </strong>As Slick stomps around the lab, he accidentally knocks over Gattlebee’s in-progress\n      experiments and countless gold pieces’ worth of materials. To say nothing of the cost, these accidents create an\n      explosive and dangerous mess.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n  <img src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/SLICK.webp\" alt=\"It's a giant chameleon\" class=\"float-right\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/SLICK.webp')\">\n  <p>\n    <strong>Shrinking Slick: </strong>Gattlebee’s system of organization is arcane, to say the least. One\n    <em>shrinking potion</em> is nestled among dozens of unlabeled vials, beakers, and flasks scattered about\n    Gattlebee’s lab. Based on his offhanded description of the potion (“greenish-yellow-blue, kinda bubbly,” he grunts\n    from his bedroom), a character must succeed at a @Check[perception|dc:20|traits:action:seek|name:Seek] check to\n    Seek to find the potion by sight alone. Alternatively, a character can spend 3 actions to thoughtfully test the most\n    likely potions and make a @Check[crafting|dc:16|name:Find shrinking potion] check. Either way, on a success, a\n    character locates the <em>shrinking potion</em> necessary to counteract Gattlebee’s growth serum.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Finding the potion may be the easy part; getting the panicked lizard to ingest the liquid is another matter\n    entirely. A character trained in alchemical bombs can make a ranged Strike against Slick (AC 18) to throw the potion\n    into the lizard’s mouth; if a character Readies this Strike and designates Slick’s tongue Strike as the trigger, the\n    character gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A character who can’t throw bombs can get the potion into Slick’s mouth if the lizard becomes grabbed or restrained.\n    To do so, the character holding the potion must be adjacent to Slick and must succeed at a\n    @Check[acrobatics|dc:18|name:Force Feed] or @Check[athletics|dc:18|name:Force Feed] check. At your\n    discretion, characters can employ other creative ideas or tactics to get Slick to drink the potion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In any case, a failed attack or check causes the potion to land in a nearby space, while a critical failure causes\n    the potion to break and spill all over the floor, rendering it useless. (A character adjacent to Slick can spend a\n    reaction to attempt a @Check[reflex|dc:17|name:Catch Potion] save to catch a potion on a failed or critically\n    failed attempt, preventing the potion from breaking.) A success means Slick ingests the potion and shrinks to normal\n    size after 1 round. On a critical success, the effects are immediate, and Slick instantly reverts to his usual size.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the characters subdue Slick without killing him, he reverts to his normal size after 5 minutes. Gattlebee thanks\n    the characters and rewards them with the items listed under Treasure, below. If Slick dies, Gattlebee’s attitude\n    toward the characters changes to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.I1ffBVISxLr2gC4u]{unfriendly}, and he doesn’t offer\n    them the below items to help with their mission.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Treasure:</strong> @UUID[Actor.pZQVFzXpsHa0rCJJ]{Gattlebee's Reward} @UUID[Actor.wvkoRFw2Ca6ZG4Y7]{Gattlebee's Reward (Killed Slick)}</p>\n    <p>If the characters leave Slick alive, Gattlebee offers the party a bundle of helpful\n    alchemical items.

Though the brewery\n  goes up for auction soon, a group of adventurers temporarily settled in the abandoned building before they set off\n  again. The seven wanderers call themselves the Iron Hunters. They’re a mix of humans and dwarves who, each for their\n  own reason, live on the city’s fringes, where they hunt monsters, search ruins for treasure, and generally get by as\n  urban adventurers. When shieldmarshals or other organizations in Alkenstar seek specialists in city adventuring, urban\n  exploration, or underworld politicking, they often call upon the aid of groups such as this.\n</p>\n<img\n  class=\"float-right\"\n  src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_SQUATTER.webp\"\n  alt=\"An older man with a tanned complexion, generous grey beard, and goggles around his head.\"\n  style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_SQUATTER.webp')\"\n  ;=\"\" />\n<p>\n  The Iron Hunters are led by a skilled forager originally hailing from Nex named <strong>Kasali</strong> (LN male human\n  trapper 1). Kasali was once a skilled wizard in the Nexian military, but he abandoned his post many years ago and fled\n  to Alkenstar. In a city where spellcraft is often unreliable, Kasali’s magical knack was much less useful, but he\n  found pride and a sense of community in the ruins of Ironside Quarter. Like Kasali, the rest of the Iron Hunters don’t\n  maintain a neat appearance by design; clean faces and fresh clothes stand out against the gray and brown grime of\n  western Alkenstar. The last thing Kasali and his crew want to do while hunting monsters is stand out.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The septet gathered most of the food and useful tools from the Yeast of All Brewery. They intended to depart soon, but\n  they’ve gotten in something of a bind.

Worse, the two clockworks are able to wind each other up, meaning they’ll remain a danger to anyone who enters\n  the taproom until the clockworks are destroyed.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Kasali found a set of spare keys when they first arrived, allowing the adventurers to leave through the bay doors in\n  this area and lock up after themselves. After Bolsa discovered some aggressive wasps in the work area (area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17803runand.JournalEntryPage.03workroom000000]{D4}</strong>), they locked that room as\n  well for everyone’s safety.

The Iron Hunters are bickering in the meantime, and\n  Kasali fears this incident might spell the end of his harmonious band of monster hunters.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Hunters’ Aid:</strong> As long as the characters are amiable, the Iron Hunters respond in kind, though their\n  initial attitude toward the party is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fuG8dgthlDWfWjIA]{Indifferent}.

Are there\n    other powers involved in this? If so, who are they, and how much do they\n    know?

That leaves us with quite a quandary... who exactly hired\n      these rascals?”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She strokes her chin as she thinks aloud. “I suppose they could have come\n      after the formula for pyronite themselves... they do like blowing things\n      up. But this seems like too big of a play for them to make on their\n      own—too organized and too intentional, as well. The Punks usually focus on\n      casual arson and snorting gunpowder.”\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After a moment, Dunsmith slams a fist on the table. “Dammit, okay.

Now get.”\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    If prompted, Dunsmith has very little else to say on the matter, but the\n    issue obviously has her spooked. She’s still willing to give all the\n    characters free room and board as long as they’re working for her, along\n    with access to the crafting tools in the back rooms of the saloon. If the\n    characters ask Gattlebee about it, he just snorts. “Figures,” he says. “You\n    make one new thing, one discovery, and suddenly everyone wants to make money\n    off it. I don’t know who all is after me. I just want to be able to work in\n    peace.”\n  </p>\n\n"

Scribbled on the back of the flyer are the words “last bell\n    before sundown.” They also found Gattlebee’s name and address written on an\n    order form for alchemical reagents. The form had a symbol of a flying corvid\n    grasping vials of liquid stamped in the upper right corner.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the characters have forgotten about these clues or somehow missed them,\n    Gattlebee mentions the papers. “Didn’t take these criminals for reading\n    types, but they carried some scratch paper.

But to get there from the front\n    door, the characters (whose descriptions are well known to the gang after their fight at Bottleneck Bridge) must\n    either blend in with the dance hall’s guests or else risk a brawl with the Powderkeg Punk bouncers.\n  </p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/Powderkeg Punk Brawler.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/Powderkeg Punk Brawler.webp')\" ;=\"\">\n  <p>\n    Each character in the party can attempt a single DC 18 check to somehow get across the dance hall unnoticed. They\n    can try dancing (@Check[performance|dc:18|name:Dancing] or @Check[acrobatics|dc:18|name:Dancing]),\n    mingling (@Check[diplomacy|dc:18|name:mingling] or @Check[deception|dc:18|name:mingling]), or showing off\n    (@Check[athletics|dc:18|name:Showing off] or @Check[intimidation|dc:18|name:Showing off]). If at least\n    half the characters succeed at their checks, they blend in with the club’s patrons or otherwise make it across the\n    hall without drawing undue attention. Otherwise, a group of Powderkeg Punk bouncers confront the party (see Bar\n    Brawl, below).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once they’ve blended in with the rest of the hall’s revelers, the characters must figure out a way to actually get\n    into the back room. They might Sneak in with a @Check[stealth|dc:18|traits:action:sneak|name:Sneak] check,\n    Climb around the outside of the building and slip in through a window with an\n    @Check[athletics|dc:18|traits:action:climb|name:Climb] check, or even Lie or Coerce their way past the Punks\n    guarding the door with an @Check[intimidation|dc:18|traits:action:coerce|name:Coerce] or\n    @Check[deception|dc:18|traits:action:lie|name:Lie] check. In every case, the DC for the check is 18. Once all\n    the characters succeed, they gain access to the back room. If any character fails, the Punks take notice and dish\n    out some punishment (see Bar Brawl, below).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Bar Brawl:</strong> If the characters fail to blend in with the dance hall’s patrons or fail to get into the\n    back room, they draw the attention of the Powderkeg Punk bouncers working at the Hippodrome that night. The bouncers\n    aren’t coordinated; a wayward punch hits a patron and before anyone can react, the entire dance hall has descended\n    into a good old-fashioned bar brawl.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    You can run this scene as a combat encounter or abstract it. To abstract the brawl, ask each player to describe what\n    their character is doing to win the nonlethal brawl, then have them roll the appropriate attack roll or skill check\n    (DC 18). On a success, the character earns 1 Brawl Point. After a character has acted, a bouncer acts against that\n    character. The character must attempt a @Check[fortitude|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect|name:Shove],\n    @Check[reflex|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect|name:Dodge Chair], or\n    @Check[will|dc:18|traits:damaging-effect|name:Resist Taunt] save as the bouncer pushes them, throws a chair at\n    them, or taunts them, respectively. If the character succeeds at their saving throw, they earn 1 Brawl Point.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After each party member has acted once and made one saving throw, the brawl is over. Inevitably the characters win,\n    but not before taking their fair share of punches. Characters with 2 Brawl Points take no damage, characters with 1\n    Brawl Point take [[/r 3d6[nonlethal]]]{3d6 nonlethal damage}, and characters with 0 Brawl Points take [[/r 6d6[nonlethal]]]{6d6 nonlethal damage}. Once the brawl is over, the Punks have no fight left in them and flee,\n    letting the party have access to the back room.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>The Back Room:</strong> This small room is little more than a worn-down office, scuffed desk and ragged\n    couch included.

Eventually, the Old Widgetworks\n    Warehouse, as it soon became known throughout the Ferrous Quarter, was then\n    used as a hideout by numerous gangs until the Bank of Abadar finally\n    abandoned the property altogether. Currently, the Powderkeg Punks occupy\n    this once-fine establishment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The warehouse is in a rough part of the Ferrous Quarter where shieldmarshals\n    rarely patrol.

A\n    character can attempt a\n    @Check[athletics|dc:20|traits:action:force-open|name:Force Open] check\n    to Force Open the bay doors, but doing so attracts the attention of the\n    Punks inside, who are a jumpy lot and would assume their territory was under\n    attack.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Narrow ventilation windows throughout the building and two broken skylights\n    in area\n    <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04powderkegwar00]{E2}</strong>\n    are obvious but perilous points of entrance, and a rusty sewage drain in the\n    center of the warehouse floor is just wide enough for a Medium creature to\n    @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.kMcV8e5EZUxa6evt]{Squeeze} through.

Whispersheets define any given hour into two major categories, Bronzetime or\n    Surgetime. During Bronzetime, experts predict higher chances of magical stability and stable weather, while an hour\n    of Surgetime indicates an increased likelihood of magical surges and rapid atmospheric fluctuations.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    What this means for groups of Pathfinder players is a greater emphasis on tracking in-game time to ensure\n    spellcasters in the party can make full, reliable use of their abilities. This also entails a greater lift on your\n    part as the GM, since you’ll need to create forecasts that are at least semi-reliable so your players can plan their\n    moves wisely. Whispersheets’ 48-hour forecasts can generally be relied on, but farther-out predictions are less\n    certain. Of course, NPCs’ and monsters’ magical abilities should be likewise impacted by Surgetime.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To avoid putting spellcasting characters at a significant disadvantage, the Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path\n    doesn’t make use of Bronzetime and Surgetime by default; the unpredictable nature of magic is instead represented by\n    several dramatic mana storm encounters, all of which are made known to the characters well in advance. If you want\n    to include Bronzetime and Surgetime in your Outlaws of Alkenstar Adventure Path, clear this with your players before\n    beginning the campaign, since it no doubt will impact what kinds of characters your players choose to create.\n  </p>\n</aside>\n<p>\n  A Powderkeg Punk is stationed in this room around the clock with strict orders to keep an eye on the neighborhood,\n  keep intruders out, and only open the door for those with the password.

He rubs the grey-brown fur around his\n    green eyes before speaking, his voice surprisingly deep for a goblin. “Do my eyes deceive me, or did you actually\n    track me down? Hoo hoo! You must either want to kill me...” The hooligans above chortle and jeer, cocking the\n    hammers of their pistols and licking their vials of alchemist’s fire intimidatingly.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    “...or you just want to know why.” The leader’s tail swishes back and forth excitedly. “Why, that is, would a bunch\n    of powder-snortin’, fire-lightin’ hoodlums like us care about some eggheaded book-thumper? Am I right?” He idly\n    fingers a delicate key in his clockwork armor, then his face brightens suddenly, as though a thought just occurred\n    to him. “Give you a deal? One time only! You fight Bitey, my pet snake I stole fair and square. Whoever survives can\n    ask me questions! Deal?” His eyes dart between the party and the large pair of double doors to the west.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Glaz Nixbrix is far more patient and eloquent than the rest of his hotheaded crew—one of the reasons he’s the boss. He\n  gives the party some time to talk among themselves. It’s likely the characters will have questions before they decide\n  whether to take him up on his offer. The following are some of the characters’ likely inquiries and Nixbrix’s\n  responses.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What if we just kill you?</strong> Nixbrix looks up at the four gunners on the catwalk, then licks a finger\n  and holds it up. “You can try, but I sense it might be raining lead soon.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Why would you want us to kill your pet snake?</strong> “I’ve fed Bitey several people who owed me and couldn’t\n  pay, but watching them get eaten has just gotten boring. Plus, Bitey eats a lot. If you kill her, one less mouth to\n  feed!”\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>What exactly is this pet snake? </strong>“Wanna find out?” Nixbrix holds his hands up as if to clap, waiting\n  for the word.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Will you tell us who hired you/why you tried to kidnap Gattlebee?</strong>\n  “Oh yes! Anything you want to know! I have no secrets to hide... Okay, I have some secrets. But I’ll tell you all I\n  know about the egghead. Both of them.” Nixbrix winks but doesn’t elaborate on what he means by “both of them” just\n  yet.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>Is there something we could trade/how much can we pay you?</strong>\n  “I’ll take five pounds of pyronite. I wanna blow up something big! No? Well, I guess you better choose the snake.”\n</p>\n<p>\n  Once they’re done grilling Nixbrix for information, the characters can decide to fight Bitey or beat the answers out\n  of Nixbrix himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If they decide to fight Nixbrix, he and his Punks are ready for a scrap and the party is in for a severe-threat\n  encounter. If able, the bombardier at the front door (area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04warehouserec00]{E1}</strong>) runs to get help while\n  the gunners stay on the catwalk, firing down on the characters from above. Nixbrix uses skirmishing tactics—he moves\n  away from the characters to fire his really big gun, then closes in again to pound them with his buzz-saw knuckles.\n  When he falls to fewer than 20 Hit Points, he Leaps Away on his next turn, hoping to flee and live to fight another\n  day. If reduced to fewer than 5 Hit Points, he surrenders ignobly and begrudgingly complies with the characters’\n  demands.\n</p>\n<p>\n  If the outlaws agree to fight his pet snake, Nixbrix claps his hands, sits back, then pulls on a lever integrated into\n  the throne. The doors to the west open by a mechanism in the warehouse, and the emperor cobra in area\n  <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17804turnth.JournalEntryPage.04biteysden00000]{E3}</strong> emerges.

This part of\n    Alkenstar is built into the west side of the Hellfallen Cliffs directly\n    across from the Screw, a giant crane capable of raising or lowering ships up\n    and down the 500-foot-tall Alken Falls waterfall. Hellside started as a\n    shanty town full of merchants looking to trade with ship captains stuck in\n    the Screw’s several hours–long ascent or descent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A complicated network of stair and walkways built into the cliffside grant\n    access to several cave-like shops, inns, apartments, and a recently built\n    carnival area. The folks there are friendly to outsiders—as long as they’re\n    buying. Otherwise, the community tends to be fairly insular and mistrustful\n    of official law enforcement, such as the shieldmarshals. The constant spray\n    from Alken Falls keeps the south side of Hellside damp and less preferable\n    for travelers and residents alike. The north side often has much more foot\n    traffic and pop-up outdoor shops that are little more than a merchant with a\n    dry rug covered in various wares.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In the past decade, the Church of Abadar has attempted to legitimize the\n    businesses here by carving huge statues of Abadar’s aspects into the\n    cliffside, with a temple, shops, and apartments beyond. They also installed\n    the Hellside Crane, a very large crane for hauling goods, though not nearly\n    as large as the Screw. Ultimately, the church’s attempts to push Hellside\n    into an upscale business district failed. A local council of merchants\n    controls the neighborhood government and generally avoids interactions with\n    the shieldmarshals, making this a great place for nefarious business\n    ventures and underhanded schemes.

The div happened to be passing by,\n    disguised in a thick hooded cloak, when they telepathically sensed the name\n    Lyzerius on one of the characters’ minds. Now, Gah’tesh is convinced these\n    mortals must be allies of the alchemist who betrayed them (see\n    <strong>Event 7</strong> for details on Gah’tesh’s motives). Gah’tesh\n    decides to capture and torture the characters to get information about\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17806advent.JournalEntryPage.06shomalyzeriu00]{Shoma Lyzerius}, after which the div intends to kill the traitorous ifrit.\n    Reasoning with the evil, irate div doesn’t work under any\n    circumstances—Gah’tesh is out for blood.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The character with the highest Perception modifier spots Gah’tesh following\n    them.

Whatever\n    the case, unless they kill Lyzerius outright the characters are destined to\n    meet him again briefly in the third and final adventure of the Outlaws of\n    Alkenstar Adventure Path, “The Smoking Gun.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> For defeating Shoma Lyzerius and learning that\n    someone else has devised a copycat formula for pyronite, award each\n    character 80 XP.\n  </p>\n\n"

Indeed, the cosmopolitan\n    traveler who does venture inside is likely to be greeted with derogatory comments from a goggle-clad goblin inventor\n    or by rude stares from a hard-drinking patron long since mutated by the wild magic of the Mana Wastes. To mitigate\n    this reception, the dwarven gunslinger behind the bar, Foebe Dunsmith, is always ready to share a welcoming word and\n    a drink on the house. Even so, this is the kind of bar where an introduction—or a good deal of diplomatic hard\n    work—is necessary to navigate the dwarven desperados, goblin grenadiers, irascible inventors, and hard-drinking\n    hoodlums who make up the unruly crowd of regulars. Jumping into a high-stakes game of bootbeer (an unexplainably\n    popular guessing game in which players try to hide as much beer on their person as possible) or wagering on a hand\n    of cards can win friends, but it can just as easily make enemies.

As they seeded money into other projects in the Ferrous Quarter, the one-time wagon-works became\n    a popular gathering spot, and Sionnek’s partner, Tenryt, decided to start serving drinks.

                            "text": "\n<p>\n  From the outside, there’s very little to recommend the Barrel &amp; Bullet. The saloon’s street-facing entrance can\n  be accessed via a sturdy wooden ramp attached to a far less sturdy, low, asymmetrical porch. The porch’s effect of\n  cheapening the establishment’s appearance from the get-go is an ironic result, considering it was built to enhance\n  the saloon’s appearance, not worsen it. It was also meant to attract more customers—one owner even had grand\n  ambitions of setting out some simple lounge chairs—but the smoggy Ferrous Quarter isn’t exactly known as a great\n  place for outdoor congregating, and so those plans swiftly fell apart. Currently, the neglected platform’s only\n  function is to hold several of the saloon’s namesake barrels, all empty and rotten.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The porch leads directly into the heart of the saloon: the\n  @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.052taproom000000]{Taproom}. Although a large chamber\n  with high ceilings and wagon-wheel chandeliers, the taproom still feels cramped and congested. Its tables are often\n  at capacity, with additional patrons standing around and resting their drinks, plates, or cards on barrels. The\n  taproom’s walls are cluttered with faded but colorful murals, clockwork devices in various states of working order,\n  and other bric-a-brac collected over the decades and passed down from owner to owner; Foebe Dunsmith has respected\n  this tradition by adding her own touches while also keeping up all the many curios she inherited.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The taproom’s most arresting feature is an impressively long bar opposite the front doors. This solid slab of jack\n  wood reinforced with iron straps stretches over 30 feet long. From behind this eye-catching altar, Foebe Dunsmith\n  holds court with her sparse retinue of barbacks, servers, and cooks. Rare is the night when Foebe can’t be found\n  behind the bar. On the occasions when she has other matters to tend to (particularly her work as a secret informant\n  for Alkenstar’s grand duchess), one of her two most trusted employees—her cousin Foseerter or her constructed\n  assistant <strong>Vuskean</strong> (LN agender automaton bartender 4)—ably takes over. Once the saloon closes for\n  the night, the tables and barrels are pushed aside to allow weary or drunk patrons to sleep on the floor (for a\n  reasonable price) under Vuskean’s watchful eye.\n</p>\n<p>\n  On any given night, the atmosphere of the Barrel &amp; Bullet feels charged with excitement as well as mild danger,\n  like a raucous party that’s just one spilled drink away from erupting into a full-on melee. Attracting Ferrous\n  Quarter regulars who seek a spot not beholden to the entrenched street gangs, the clientele tends to be assertive\n  and garrulous—hard-edged survivors or workhands looking for a place to blow off steam. The largest crowd of patrons\n  usually shows up in the late afternoon and gradually dwindles until closing, at which point Foebe must invariably\n  ask the few remaining drinkers to go home or pay for a night’s sleep on the taproom’s sticky floor. Those who want\n  to get in on card games and other wagers need to arrive early to catch a spot at the rickety tables, where space is\n  always at a premium. Seats at the bar are likewise a precious commodity.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Most nights, at least one fight erupts, usually with fists and chairs flying and a table flipping over. Foebe does\n  her best to keep the lid on such activities, directing her capable bouncer Ershap to force brawlers out the door\n  before the guns come out. Occasionally, the fighting gets out of hand: patrons cower under tables as Foebe shouts\n  from behind the bar, and at least one window invariably shatters as a body flies through it. If she really wants to\n  return the bar to order in a hurry, Foebe isn’t afraid to fire a warning shot from her dwarven scattergun; the many\n  holes that riddle the ceiling above the bar testify that the rounds fired aren’t blanks. At this, most of the rowdy\n  patrons settle down and return to their pints. The speed with which the taproom as a whole recovers from such\n  calamitous brawls speaks volumes to the roughness of life in the Ferrous Quarter.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Food and Drink</h2>\n<p>\n  The Barrel &amp; Bullet offers good food at decent prices. Though not especially famous for any of its fare, the\n  saloon does offer some notable house specialties. Among these are fresh-caught “Ustradi oysters” (a particularly\n  ugly crayfish palatable only with a thick pat of butter); a full-course meal of seasonal vegetables, a generous hunk\n  of meat (typically goat), flatbread, and fig jam; and an unappealingly named but nutritionally dense stew called\n  brown bullet curry. During the winter months, Dunsmith procures spice cakes and seasonal drinks such as locally made\n  mulled ice wine, hot whiskey, or even the occasional barrel of apple cider imported from Avistan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Prices are generally lower at the Barrel &amp; Bullet than other Smokeside taverns, thanks in part to Dunsmith’s\n  unique connection: her service to the grand duchess gives her a quiet edge in Alkenstar’s complicated procurement\n  process for the city’s imported food staples. Even with this advantage, though, the supplies available to the modest\n  saloon are unpredictable at best, so the menu changes every few days. Fortunately, Foseerter enjoys the challenge\n  and experiments freely with the food offerings. They get up early to make a variety of breads, pastries, and savory\n  pies. When they have access to sugar, the whole day’s baking is sweet, but usually, they use heartier grains to make\n  braided loaves and chewy buns that pair well with their slow-simmered stews.\n</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc table\">table\"&gt;Services and Fare</h1>\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bulletworks use (per hour)</td>\n      <td>1 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bulletworks use (per day)</td>\n      <td>1 gp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Firearm services</td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cleaning (per gun)</td>\n      <td>1 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Repair (per day)</td>\n      <td>1 gp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Firing range (per day)</td>\n      <td>2 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Sleeping accommodations (per night)</td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Taproom floor space</td>\n      <td>5 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bed (for 1)</td>\n      <td>3 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Private room (for 2)</td>\n      <td>1 gp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bread of the day</td>\n      <td>1 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Brown bullet curry</td>\n      <td>2 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Full-course meal</td>\n      <td>4 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Spice cake</td>\n      <td>5 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Stew (broth only)</td>\n      <td>5 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Stew (with meat)</td>\n      <td>1 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Ustradi oysters</td>\n      <td>2 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Dunsmith’s dram</td>\n      <td>5 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Flaming whiskey</td>\n      <td>7 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gear greaser</td>\n      <td>6 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Ghostly wainright</td>\n      <td>2 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Grenadier’s revenge</td>\n      <td>1 sp</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Smokeside sour</td>\n      <td>2 cp</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/FOEBE_DUNSMITH_FULL_FINAL.webp\" alt=\"\"\n  style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/FOEBE_DUNSMITH_FULL_FINAL.webp')\" ;=\"\">\n<p>\n  More than the food, the drinks at the Barrel &amp; Bullet are what bring in the patrons. Foebe and Foseerter craft\n  the saloon’s famous mixed drinks, but credit for the bar’s signature drink, the flaming whiskey, goes to Neekle\n  Burnwater. Neekle refuses to disclose the exact ingredients, but just three drops of his tincture in a glass of\n  whiskey and alchemically treated water cause an immediate reaction of brilliant-hued flames. A favorite betting game\n  requires a round of flaming whiskeys and the ornate clockwork timer on the bar. Contestants choose a number of\n  seconds and place bets, and then Foebe starts the timer. At the chosen time, contestants quaff the flaming drink.\n  Whoever finishes the drink first—without setting their facial hair, eyebrows, or any accessories on fire—wins.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The reason that flaming whiskey doesn’t set every drinker’s face on fire has less to do with skill than with the\n  curious way the unstable magic taints the alcohol. Even when the same drink is mixed the same way, the magic’s\n  influence is unpredictable, and results in a different effect every time. In other words, Neekle’s secret mixture\n  creates flames, but whether those flames are an illusion or an inferno or a hallucination or something else entirely\n  creates flames, but whether those flames are an illusion or an inferno or a hallucination or something else entirely\n  depends on what sort of magic hides in the whiskey.

He sports the duster, cowboy hat, and brace of pistols of a typical gunslinger, and he spins\n    some great tales about his forays outside of the city, styling himself as a mercenary. His real dealings happen\n    right under the noses of the local authorities. Foebe suspects that he has some sort of hidden side job, but she has\n    yet to figure out his true connections. Meanwhile, he’s closer than any of the other regulars to discovering Foebe’s\n    own secret.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Ershap</strong> (LN female catfolk bouncer 5): Ershap has worked as the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon’s bouncer\n    since before Foebe Dunsmith became its proprietor. To the uninitiated, Ershap’s age and lithe build don’t seem\n    formidable, but new guests who underestimate her and get disruptive only make this mistake once. Ershap carries a\n    gun but rarely resorts to it—not only does she draw on years of training in martial arts, but she also isn’t afraid\n    to bite. She is Foebe’s only true confidante and knows how to facilitate meetings between the grand duchess’s envoys\n    and her drink-slinging boss without anyone being the wiser. Ershap seems omnipresent at the saloon, vigilant night\n    after night in the barroom and often sleeping during the day in an unoccupied\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.0513guestrooms00]{guest room}. The truth is that she\n    doesn’t have a home or family to call her own. Raised in an Alkenstar orphanage, she gives most of her pay to that\n    institution. She carries a single token—a locket—that’s the only clue to her parentage; even though she’s fearless\n    in confronting the saloon’s patrons, she doesn’t have the courage to search for her kin.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Foebe Dunsmith</strong> (NG female dwarf spy 6): The story Foebe tells about becoming the proprietor of the\n    Barrel &amp; Bullet presents it as the de facto prize of a rifle competition that she won years ago. The contest was\n    rigged, with the saloon owner, Volessim, planning to rake it in when bets on the chosen winner paid off. When Foebe\n    beat that chosen winner against all odds, the owner didn’t have the prize cash and deeded over the saloon instead.\n    The truth is a bit more complicated, involving operatives of the Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia who persuaded Volessim\n    to capitulate because they wanted to install Foebe, an informant for the grand duchess, in his place. Foebe keeps\n    with the version that emphasizes her skill and her triumph against the odds, themes that resonate with her dwarven\n    upbringing as well as her public persona. From behind her saloon’s counter, Foebe welcomes everyone who comes in,\n    though she might quickly rescind that invitation depending on behavior. Genuinely outgoing and interested in others,\n    she contributes her own zest for life to the often rowdy atmosphere of her tavern. That atmosphere also makes it\n    easy for her to learn a great deal about the goings-on in the Ferrous Quarter and elsewhere, as her comfortably\n    inebriated guests confide in her. She thus uses her status as a humble-but-capable saloon owner to further the grand\n    duchess’s farther-reaching aims from the city’s ground floor.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Foseerter Dunsmith</strong> (LG nonbinary dwarf saloon manager 3): Because Foebe prefers the role of barkeep\n    and everyone’s-best-friend, she relies on her cousin Foseerter to handle the saloon’s administrative work. Foseerter\n    hires everyone from the kitchen staff to the bouncers and makes sure the larder is full, the kegs are tapped, and\n    the beds are made. Much quieter than their cousin, Foseerter prefers to stay out of the way and derives great\n    satisfaction from everything going smoothly, occasional bar fights or explosions notwithstanding. Foseerter has no\n    idea about Foebe’s secret life as an informant, and in turn, Foebe has no idea that Foseerter is haunted by their\n    brief stint as an adventurer. Foseerter left two wounded comrades behind in the Mana Wastes and still has nightmares\n    about that decision. They would like to venture out to recover whatever remains from that fateful day, but they’re\n    far too afraid.\n  </p>\n  <img style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/NEEKLE_BURNWATER_FINAL.webp')\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/NEEKLE_BURNWATER_FINAL.webp\" alt=\"neekle burnwater showing off his bartending skills\" class=\"float-right\">\n  <p>\n    <strong>Neekle Burnwater </strong>(CG male goblin tinkerer 4): Intelligent and driven, Neekle can’t help but tinker\n    with anything in his hands (including his drinks). His inventions, including the flaming whiskey, have garnered him\n    a modest living and a small amount of local fame. A regular at the Barrel &amp; Bullet, Neekle often takes over a\n    table in the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.0511thebulletw00]{Bulletworks} to pull an\n    apparatus apart or pore over some sketches. He’s always willing to help mend a broken gun or a damaged clockwork in\n    exchange for a drink, though he won’t settle for merely fixing something—he’ll do his best to improve it! Neekle has\n    struggled with the dismissive attitude that many Alkenstar residents have toward goblins, and his calm disposition\n    and lack of impulsivity make the stereotypes particularly painful. He hopes that his most impressive invention, a\n    contraption that’s still under development and “top secret,” will surely change everything for both him and the\n    city’s other goblins!\n  </p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/WAYSELM_DAVRELL_FINAL.webp\" alt=\"the half orc bounty hunter wayselm davrell\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/WAYSELM_DAVRELL_FINAL.webp')\" ;=\"\">\n  <p>\n    <strong>Wayselm Davrell</strong> (N female tiefling half-orc bounty hunter 2): Between missions, Wayselm makes the\n    Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon her home.

Double doors on the west lead to the\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.051porch00000000]{Porch}, and a small door in the\n    southeastern corner leads to the\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17805barrel.JournalEntryPage.056kitchen000000]{Kitchen}. Opposite the front doors, a\n    bar made of hardwood and braced with steel straps stretches over 30 feet along the western wall of the taproom. It\n    stands tall, accommodating humans, orcs, and other humanoids. To adapt to this uncomfortable height, Foebe has\n    installed a clever contraption consisting of a clockwork stool on a rail. She can slide up and down the bar, raising\n    and lowering her height as well as standing or sitting as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Crafted from various metal pieces, the base of the bar seems fused from cast-off wheels, spare clockwork parts, and\n    sheets of repurposed steel. The top, hammered from salvaged pieces of wood into a motley dining surface, suits its\n    utilitarian purpose. Foebe stores alcohol in capacious, locked cabinets under the bar, rather than on the backwall\n    where they might tempt less-scrupulous patrons to over-indulge or even try their hand at some impromptu target\n    practice.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Barrel &amp; Bullet’s unique bar is much more than a place for Foebe to sling drinks and eavesdrop on\n    conversations. Behind and among the liquor cabinets, the bar has several secret compartments, including a safe that\n    holds Foebe’s small fortune and the deed to the saloon. Other secret compartments contain missives or items she\n    surreptitiously passes to agents of the grand duchess posing as regular saloon-goers. One cleverly hidden, padlocked\n    drawer contains a clockwork recording device that Dunsmith occasionally employs to capture conversations of patrons\n    she suspects might be working for any of Alkenstar’s criminal enterprises. The device is a marvel in itself, but the\n    secrets contained within it are far more valuable, and many forces (illicit and otherwise) would pay dearly to hear\n    some of the things it’s heard.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Each of the bar’s secret compartments are trapped.

He wouldn’t live by their rules anymore; he would\n    never live by anyone’s rules again except for his own.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Nixbrix made his way to the Garundi continent with the intention of living\n    for himself and no one else. Alkenstar sounded like the perfect place to do\n    just that—a land with new technology and promises of a bright future.\n    Furthermore, the region’s frequent mana storms would stifle any divination\n    spells his family might use to track him down. He felt like he’d just struck\n    gold, a feeling reinforced by the metallic towers, auburn skies, and shiny\n    brass clockworks that populated his new home. But after spending just a few\n    days in the City of Smog, Nixbrix discovered that Alkenstar had just as many\n    rules as his monkey goblin community, only he didn’t know what they were.\n    The immigrant’s ignorance of the law didn’t stop the shieldmarshals from\n    trying to arrest him, though. Before Nixbrix knew what was what, he was on\n    the run and scavenging to survive.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    He fell in with some petty criminals, pickpockets, con artists, and\n    arsonists. These individuals would become his best friends in the world.\n    They traveled the city together, taking what they wanted, running from the\n    shieldmarshals, and living life only for themselves. This was the freedom\n    Nixbrix was searching for: no rules to follow but his own, no matter what\n    other people thought.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The gang did pretty well for a time. They stole some fancy prototype\n    wearable clockwork armor from a gnome inventor, though only Nixbrix was\n    small enough to fit inside it. The gang took the thing for a spin, using the\n    oversized firearm strapped to its back to blast through doors and windows\n    when invading rival gangs’ territories. Nixbrix, never one for subtlety,\n    often aimed for the walls of buildings for the gang’s entrances, and he\n    quickly developed a reputation as the “Brick Blaster of Ferrous Quarter.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    As time went on, Nixbrix lost touch with his old crew, often because of\n    arrests or shoot-outs with the shieldmarshals, but he was always meeting new\n    people. He also started to understand the ins and outs of his special armor.\n    He even made a few modifications himself, like his innovative buzz-saw\n    knuckles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    One day, while staring at a massive factory fire that seemingly sprung out\n    of nowhere, Nixbrix saw a group of people running from the conflagration,\n    the shieldmarshals hot on their tail. Nixbrix decided to help some fellow\n    criminals out, bust some shieldmarshal skulls, and maybe make a few friends\n    on the way. After beating down the shieldmarshals, he hid out with the\n    people they’d been chasing and learned why they’d set the fire. “For the fun\n    of it,” it turns out, was exactly the kind of answer Nixbrix was hoping for.\n    They became fast friends. Not long after, someone floated the idea of giving\n    their little gang an official name, something to stoke fear into the hearts\n    of other Alkenstar outlaws.

Though he felt\n    that he was smarter than the rest of his peers combined, they constantly\n    treated him as a mere child. Even his teachers treated Lyzerius as less\n    than, believing that someone so young must have cheated to gain entrance to\n    the prestigious college.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Determined to show everyone that he deserved his place at Blythir, Lyzerius\n    snuck into the school’s labs late at night to perform daring experiments\n    that would prove his genius. One of these experiments—a new type of\n    alchemist’s fire that could burn brighter and hotter than any before—was\n    such a catastrophic failure (or success, depending on one’s point of view)\n    that it burned the alchemy lab to the ground.

As it turned out, he did so just as his ifrit\n    blood manifested. Suddenly, he could spark fire from his fingertips, his\n    eyes turned a burnished golden hue, and he grew to his full height. His skin\n    darkened to a warm brown, the color of smoldering earth, and his pale hair\n    literally burned away as follicles of living fire replaced it.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    At first, Lyzerius resented his ifrit blood, looking for a way to remove\n    what he perceived to be a curse. He wasted years of research trying to rid\n    himself of his elemental gift before he finally embraced it. At least, he\n    realized, he would never get called small or puny again; few in Alkenstar\n    would have the courage to say such things to a man bathed in perpetual\n    flame.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Confidence restored, Lyzerius dedicated himself to alchemy, studying the\n    subject on his own and perfecting his formula for a substance he called\n    “lyzerium.” He moved into an abandoned apartment, where he discovered the\n    remains of a now-defunct cult of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.GX6PF9ifR47Xyjg9]{Norgorber}. From there, he sold his\n    creations on Alkenstar’s black market and earned a strong reputation among\n    other criminal alchemists and explosives enthusiasts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Recently, Lyzerius trespassed onto Blythir College to retrieve some old\n    notes he’d left at the school. He discovered that, in the years since he\n    left, other researchers had checked out his shelved plans from the college’s\n    library. One name in particular stood out from the list of researchers: the\n    famous alchemist inventor Vashon Gattlebee, who was rumored to be on the\n    precipice of a truly explosive discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When Lyzerius confronted Gattlebee about looking at his research notes,\n    Gattlebee flatly stated that he hardly remembered the notes, but from what\n    he could recall, they were almost entirely useless. Lyzerius fumed at\n    Gattlebee’s snub and left in a huff, annoyed but satisfied with the answer.\n    He continued working on his formula until one day Gattlebee announced a new\n    form of explosive: pyronite.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Lyzerius attended Gattlebee’s public demonstration at Blythir College and\n    saw firsthand what pyronite was capable of. Utterly enraged by the genius\n    inventor’s far superior explosive, Lyzerius sent Gattlebee letters that were\n    returned, unopened. He tried to confront Gattlebee in the latter’s shack of\n    a home but received no answer. With each rebuff, Lyzerius became further\n    convinced that Gattlebee hadn’t just used his research without crediting\n    him, Gattlebee outright stole Lyzerius’s materials. There was no way that\n    anyone could create such a potent explosive without it at least being\n    partially thanks to him.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Desperate to find out Gattlebee’s secret formula for pyronite, and to get\n    the credit he rightfully deserved, Lyzerius turned to some criminal contacts\n    and clients. He decided that if Gattlebee wouldn’t willingly part with the\n    formula, then Lyzerius would have to arrange for his rival’s kidnapping.\n    With an indignant and jealous fire burning in his heart, Lyzerius swore to\n    pry the secrets from Gattlebee and to have the other inventor admit to\n    stealing his life’s work.\n  </p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_Shoma_Lyzerius_FINAL.webp\" alt=\"\" style=\"\n      shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap178-punks-in-a-powderkeg/assets/art/PZO90178_Shoma_Lyzerius_FINAL.webp');\n    \" ;=\"\">\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h2>\n  <p>\n    In Chapter 3 of this adventure, Foebe Dunsmith pays the characters to figure\n    out who hired the Powderkeg Punks to assail the party in the hopes of\n    kidnapping Vashon Gattlebee. The party’s investigation ultimately leads the\n    characters to the embittered Shoma Lyzerius in the ramshackle hanging\n    neighborhood of Hellside. To get to the pesky alchemist himself, the\n    characters must get through his secret hideout, an abandoned temple of\n    Norgorber he’s repurposed as a laboratory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the party defeats his minions and catches him, Lyzerius is forced to\n    admit defeat, but by then he’s already given up hope anyway; he’s accepted\n    that he’ll never be on par with the likes of Gattlebee. Furthermore, word on\n    the street has it that another inventor—Lyzerius doesn’t know who,\n    exactly—has already reverse-engineered the pyronite formula. What would be\n    the point in getting Gattlebee to fess up to his intellectual theft now,\n    with the formula already in the hands of other Alkenstar crafters? Lyzerius\n    tells the party about this development with frustrated tears in his eyes.\n    The news might spell the end for Lyzerius’s explosive escapades, but it’s a\n    startling revelation to the party’s patron. At the end of this adventure,\n    Dunsmith tells the characters that if the formula for pyronite has indeed\n    been leaked, then the outlaws’ work for the grand duchess has only just\n    begun.\n  </p>\n\n"

Neekle refuses to disclose the exact ingredients, but just three drops of his tincture in a glass of whiskey and alchemically treated water cause an immediate reaction of brilliant-hued flames. A favorite betting game requires a round of flaming whiskeys and the ornate clockwork timer on the bar. Contestants choose a number of seconds and place bets, and then Foebe starts the timer. At the chosen time, contestants quaff the flaming drink. Whoever finishes the drink first—without setting their facial hair, eyebrows, or any accessories on fire—wins.",

Whether it’s a gear greaser (a pint of ale with a shot of rye whiskey), a ghostly wainwright (gin, whiskey, cream, and a dusting of pepper or paprika), a grenadier’s revenge (brandy, gin, and berry syrup), or any number of other mixed drinks served in the taproom, a drinker runs the risk of a side effect. When a character downs a mixed drink in the Barrel &amp; Bullet, roll 1d20 and consult the following table to determine what side effect, if any, occurs. Regardless, a character can’t be affected by more than one side effect in 24 hours from these drinks. Curiously, drinks taken from the building and imbibed a few paces away from the structure itself tend to not only have no magical side effects, but taste a bit blander. A character can resist a side effect with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save. Effects that grant the ability to cast a cantrip use the drinker’s class DC and character level to determine the cantrip’s results, but always function as 1st-level spells.",
