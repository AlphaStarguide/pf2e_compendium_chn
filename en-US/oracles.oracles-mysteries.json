Perhaps you hail from a culture with strong ancestral traditions, such as the Shoanti Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan), a traditional dwarven community that worships Torag's family pantheon, or a group that reveres Erastil or Pharasma. You might commune with powerful psychopomps who shepherd souls to the afterlife, with the River of Souls itself, or with those spirits who have become trapped outside of the great cycle of spiritual rebirth. You learn from their whispers and the fragments of their memories, but opening your mind to their knowledge and experience also allows them to meddle in your worldly affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Mystery Benefit</strong></p>\n<p>The whispers of your ancestors have bestowed additional knowledge upon you.

Your hair, clothing, and belongings constantly shift and stir, seemingly of their own volition.</p>\n<p><strong>Minor Curse</strong></p>\n<p>One of your ancestors becomes predominant in their meddling. The first time you gain this effect each day, roll [[/r 1d4]] on the list below to determine which type of ancestor becomes predominant. This predominant ancestor guides you to use their preferred type of action. When you try to use one of the types of actions listed for the other ancestors, you must succeed at a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, you spend the action but gain no effect (though you don't lose the spell if you were Casting a Spell). After you use the preferred action of your dominant ancestor, you do not have to attempt flat checks to perform the actions of your other ancestors until the beginning of your next turn. If your action would take 1 minute or longer, it's long enough that you can overcome the meddling, and you don't need to attempt a flat check.</p>\n<p>During combat or another tense, round-by-round encounter, other ancestors wrestle for control of your actions. When you roll initiative, and then at the end of each of your turns during the encounter, roll [[/r 1d4]] and change your predominant ancestor appropriately. Once the encounter ends, you return to the influence of the ancestor you first rolled for the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate Curse</strong></p>\n<p>The flat check DC to use other actions is 6, and you get the moderate curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor in the list below.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Curse (11th)</strong></p>\n<p>The flat check DC is 8, and you get the major curse benefit listed for your predominant ancestor instead of the moderate curse benefit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Ancestral Influence</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Martial Ancestor\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preferred action</strong> Strikes</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate curse benefit</strong> Your Strikes gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +2 status bonus to damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Major curse benefit</strong> Your Strikes gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls and a +6 status bonus to damage</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Skillful Ancestor\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preferred action</strong> Perception and Skill actions</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate curse benefit</strong> You gain a +1 status bonus to skill checks and Perception checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Major curse benefit</strong> You gain a +2 status bonus to skill checks and Perception checks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Spellcasting Ancestor\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Preferred action</strong> Cast a Spell</li>\n<li><strong>Moderate curse benefit</strong> Non-cantrip spells without a duration gain a status bonus to their damage and healing equal to the spell's level.</li>\n<li><strong>Major curse benefit</strong> Non-cantrip spells without a duration gain a status bonus to their damage and healing equal to the spell's level + 3.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You choose which ancestor guides your actions</li>\n</ol>"

Any afflictions (such as poisons, diseases, and curses) affecting you have their maximum duration, onset time, and time for each stage reduced by half. Spells, conditions, and afflictions that last \"until your next daily preparations\" last for 12 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first. This doesn't change the duration you're temporarily immune, the rate at which you can use abilities that have a frequency, or any other features based on the passage of time.</p>\n<p><strong>Major Curse (11th)</strong></p>\n<p>You become so out of sync with time that it's hard for you to act, but when you do act, you do so with incredible speed. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, the value of your enfeebled condition increases to 3, and the penalty from your minor curse increases to -4. Time passes so much faster for you that your steps appear as a blur of motion to others. You gain a +4 status bonus to initiative rolls. Whenever you move, you're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} while you're moving and until the start of your next turn. As normal for concealment where your location is still obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak}. Your status bonus to AC against attacks made against you from reactions or free actions while you're moving increases to +4. Time passes differently for you than everyone else. At the end of a turn you cast a non-cantrip spell, you can teleport to a square within half the distance of your status bonus to your speed as a free action. This action has the teleportation trait and does not trigger your benefits for moving.</p>"
