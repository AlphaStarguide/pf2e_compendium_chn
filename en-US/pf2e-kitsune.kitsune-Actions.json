			"description": "<p>You transform into a specific alternate form that you choose when you determine your heritage; once chosen, this cannot be changed. This form is the same age and body type as your true form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You lose any unarmed Strikes you gained from a kitsune heritage or ancestry feat in this form. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and you can shift back to your true kitsune form by using this action again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A tailless form is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you grew up.</li>\n<li>A fox form is a Tiny animal. Your gear is absorbed into you and you gain the animal trait, a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, and a jaws unarmed strike that deals [[/r {1d4}[piercing]]]{1d4 piercing damage} while in fox form. These jaws are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits. You can't use weapons while in fox form, nor can you use shields or other held items of any sort, and cannot take manipulate actions except to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Cast a Spell]{Cast a Spell} with somatic components or use simple Interact actions. Your fox form can't perform actions that require fingers, hands, or significant manual dexterity, including any action that would require a check to accomplish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e-kitsune.kitsune-Effects.BrUxk43Ar0xLiCSz]{Effect: Fox Form}</p>"
