		"Adanye": {
			"name": "Adanye",
			"description": "<p>Legend holds that the amurruns-known as catfolk to others-were created as guardians against threats to home, nature, and the world at large. While the goddess Adanye is not considered to be their creator, she is said to have mentored these first guardians, teaching them the skills necessary to protect and defend, both in combat and in careful interaction with others. She also taught the importance of what they protected, identifying the hearth and the home, as well as the right to self-determination and to solitude, as worthy of defense. She is said to have instilled in the amurruns their need for solitude and their esteem of imagination. A master teacher, she is depicted as a graying catfolk woman or a cat by the hearth fire, her large, gentle eyes full of wisdom.</p>\n<p>The tenets of Adanye's faith are few and flexible. She helps the curious and the wandering to retain their sense of self and their need to stay safe as they discover and grow. She honors the hours spent daydreaming on the hearth, whether that hearth is next to the fire pit at a remote campsite or in the kitchen of a generations-old homestead. She does not proscribe much. She adds to the serendipitous outlook of the catfolk, enhancing their inborn curiosity. Her worship tends to temper willfulness and wanderlust, reminding her followers of the safety and security to be found in having a spot of their own, even if that spot is temporary. She understands that sometimes the best protection is a retreat and gently reminds her followers of the virtue of impermanence and of existing in the moment. Rather than looking into the past or the future, she enjoins fully inhabiting the present-the place where one is, the hearth by which one naps, the company that one currently keeps, especially when it can be done in solitude.</p>\n<p>Because the catfolk of Southern Garund have not established large communities outside of Murraseth, there are no temples to Adanye outside of their homeland, only small shrines erected by travelers, perhaps near seldom-used mountain trails or in the corners of large temples dedicated to other gods. Her worshippers often paint or sketch her holy symbol, a simple paw print in orange (or on an orange background), which is sometimes enhanced with sketched flames or another symbol of fire, in an inconspicuous cornerstone of a building or on a fallen log. Adanye has an affinity with Desna and with Shelyn, given their overlapping interests in dreamers and individualism. Although she has a longstanding rivalry with the Osirian feline goddess Bastet, she does not spend much time feuding. Adanye's care is wholly enjoined upon her followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> keep your counsel, follow your heart, appreciate a warm hearth, defend those who welcome you into their home</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> force anyone into drudgery or mindless work, deny support to loved ones, surrender when escape is an option, destroy a place that has given you shelter</p>"

For these reasons, her likeness is often found in courts, where she can watch over and ensure fairness to those accused of crimes.

		"Angazhan": {

Called the Ravenous King and Demon Lord of Beasts, he appears as an enormous and terrifying red-furred ape with six long fingers on each hand, massive and clawed. His red eyes, twisted horns, and viciously sharp fangs give him a demonic appearance. His followers range from gnolls to charau-kas to nalfeshnee demons that number in the thousands.</p>\n<p>Angazhan has astounding presence and influence, but that influence is rivaled by his raw power. He is skilled enough with weapons, but prefers to use his own abilities-his powerful fists, lethal fangs, sharp horns, and deadly tail. His terrible grasp extends beyond life into death, as well. Occasionally, those slain in combat by Angazhan's minions are reincarnated forcefully into an ape-like creature in the service of the Ravenous King. This curse causes the victim to serve eternally, and only upon death is there a chance for their soul to be retrieved before it slips into the Boneyard, to be sent on and suffer a never-ending torment in the Abyss.</p>\n<p>A pledge to Angazhan is a commitment to acquiring power. Angazhan encourages followers to destroy all who oppose them with relentless force, to dominate until nothing is left to challenge, and to treat obstacles as something to be crushed with swiftness. Those who fail these commands are quick to be cast aside. This strength lures dangerous figures, thievish creatures, and terrifying beings. Followers share less of a bond and more of an understanding that in the end they serve a lord whose dominance can't be rivaled.</p>\n<p>Angazhan is the patron of Usaro, a feared and hated charau-ka city in the Mwangi Expanse. A representative of Angazhan, the Gorilla King, once ruled Usrao, but was recently killed, throwing the city into chaos.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Commit acts of brutal violence, test yourself against nature, make animals more dangerous</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Cower from fights, allow yourself to be resurrected instead of reincarnated</p>"

Few dragons practice divine magic, preferring to leave that to their humanoid allies. As Apsu's prime purpose is the destruction of Dahak, few non-dragons take up his cause, although honourable humanoids with an interest in draconic lore have taken up his faith from time to time. They typically wear a gold dragon's foot brooch, or have other custom-made equipment in the shape of a dragon's foot. Golarion lacks much of a centralized humanoid church of Apsu. The largest congregation of humanoid Apsu worshipers on the planet is known as the Platinum Band, which maintains relatively small centers of worship in Oppara and Absalom. Apsu is more widely worshiped by humanoids on the planet Triaxus, where he is the patron deity of the Dragon Legion. The Legion's leaders prohibit their priests from revealing Apsu's connection to Golarion, so younger legionnaires would not be tempted to prematurely journey there to help him.

Falayna also enjoys rings, and as such she is associated with events in which rings are given or exchanged, such as weddings.</p>\n<p>When the Warrior's Ring appears to mortals, her form is most often that of a muscular woman with the hair and eye colors most commonly associated with feminine beauty in the mortal's mind. She wears a bright silver breastplate on top of flowing, silken robes, her longsword <em>Betrothal</em> sheathed across her back. On her fingers she wears rings of varying colors, styles, and stones; this jewelry seems to constantly shift, as if her fingers wear all the rings found in all the worlds. Followers of Falayna include warriors, soldiers, squires, jewelers, and those engaged to be married.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Wear and make beautiful things, train for combat, recover and return lost mementos</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Disrupt or destroy romantic unions, enforce a dress code, cower from fights</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> femininity, martial training, and rings</p>"

			"name": "Fandarra",
			"description": "<p>Fandarra is primarily worshipped throughout the Realm of the Mammoth Lords as a goddess of life cycles—including fertility, birth, life, and death. Local legends claim Fandarra was birthed from the earth's womb, the legendary cave Atakal, as the first living being. From her, all other life sprang. She gave birth to all people, all animals, and all deities—except for Pharasma, the Judge of Souls, who exists outside of the cycle of life and death. The blood spilled during these labors soaked the soil, making it fertile and causing plants to grow. Blood, death, and pain are nothing to fear. Like life, they're a normal and integral part of the life cycle and should be respected. Fandarra is the Mother of All, also known as the Earth Mother or the Blood Mother, and is one of the most widely worshipped deities throughout the Realm of the Mammoth Lords.</p>\n<p>In addition to her role as a goddess of life cycles and blood, Fandarra is a goddess of knowledge. As elders educate children, so has Fandarra brought her wisdom to the beings of this world. Outside the Realm of the Mammoth Lords,</p>\n<p>Fandarra is primarily known as a goddess of giants. Within the Realm, she's depicted as a pregnant Kellid woman with a shaved head crowned by a laurel of flowers. She wears a necklace of knives that she wields against those who would usurp the cycles of life; on her shoulders rests a fur cloak suitable to the region of her worship—usually mammoth, wolf, or bear. She carries an infant in one arm and a juvenile animal in the other. Typically, this animal is a mammoth, although it can vary for followings that prize other animals more.</p>\n<p>Fandarra's religious symbol is a crescent moon emerging from a mountain. Her worshippers value balance and the cycles of life, traits which enable her faith to mesh well with the beliefs and traditions of a variety of followings. Her worshippers often gravitate toward positions of leadership or work as doulas, educators, or funerary guides that tend to the deceased. Many of Fandarra's worshippers cherish family, whether of their own blood or adopted through bonds of love; furthermore, many view friends, clanmates, and pets as extended family.

Dismayed by the chaos and loss of life, Mazludeh spurred her fellow empyreal lords into action, forming a divine concordance that protected the Garundi nation of Holomog from devastation. Mazludeh's efforts elevated her to true divinity and the status of the matron goddess of the nation of Holomog. Now the goddess of negotiations and treaties, her followers often travel with merchants and ambassadors. She is also considered the diplomat to the other empyreal lords, able to pass on prayers to those most suited to answer them and persuade celestial beings to see to their fulfillment. Throughout the Mwangi, worshippers of Mazludeh have developed a reputation for being brave, empathetic, and fair even to their enemies.</p>\n<p>Over the years, it has become increasingly common for Mwangi communities to pay homage to Mazludeh, especially when constructing new homes and settlements, although more structured worship is still rare.

Unlike her worship in other parts of the world, worshippers in Mwangi tend to embrace Mazludeh's duality. To deny either side of her would be to deny a part of her, and both are necessary to fully understand the deity.

Only a rare few mortals can master the asceticism necessary to connect with the Monad, gaining hidden knowledge and powers akin to those of other divine spellcasters.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Ensure balance between opposing forces, mediate disagreements</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Allow your personal motivations to determine a major decision</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> creation, the infinite, and truth</p>"

The quahs and their most common totems are listed below:</p>\n<p><strong>Lyrune-Quah (Moon Clan)</strong> bat, cave bear, moon, mountain lion, owl, stars</p>\n<p><strong>Shadde-Quah (Axe Clan)</strong> cliffs, eagle, sea, shark, squid, water elemental</p>\n<p><strong>Shriikirri-Quah (Hawk Clan)</strong> cloud, falcon, hawk, hippogriff, horse, wind</p>\n<p><strong>Shundar-Quah (Spire Clan)</strong> avalanche, earth elemental, mountain spire or peak, roc, spirestalker</p>\n<p><strong>Sklar-Quah (Sun Clan)</strong> aurochs, cindersnake, emberstorm, fire elemental, flames, the sun</p>\n<p><strong>Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan)</strong> ancestors, earth elemental, giant scarab beetle, vulture, will-o'-wisp, wolf</p>\n<p><strong>Tamiir-Quah (Wind Clan)</strong> air elemental, cloud, griffon, roc, storm, wind</p>\n<p>According to their own tradition, Shoanti have lived in the northwestern lands of Avistan since long before colonizers fractured the Varisians' homeland. Yet the Shoanti people still maintain their independence and traditional way of life in areas across Varisia, particularly on the Storval Plateau.</p>\n<p>Shoanti animism is rooted in a deep connection to the land. Shoanti see the earth not merely as a metaphorical parent, but as a conscious entity whose constant support is necessary for the survival of all life upon it-animal and vegetable alike. Their traditions emphasize connection and the reciprocal way in which the land provides for those who take care of it. The life force of the land serves as the source of Shoanti power and insight, rather than the otherworldly spiritual essence of the Great Beyond common to clerics. This life force is the birth of instinct and faith, and thus it sends omens to indicate future events, warning those with the wisdom to read the signs. Thus most Shoanti hold a profound reverence for natural phenomena as a manifestation of the will of the earth.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong></p>"

For the Crimson Reclaimers, this means never forgetting the pain and trauma caused by the Whispering Tyrant in Lastwall, and channeling that grief into fuel for righteous revenge. Beyond these two major divine influences, three other deities represent values the followers of the pantheon hold dear. Gorum (Our Lord in Iron) preaches strength and victory in battle. Iomedae (The Inheritor) led the charge on many successful attacks against Tar-Baphon, so it's only natural that her legendary deeds, and sense of honor, justice, and valor speak to followers of Sorrow's Sword. Many consider Arazni (The Unyielding) to be a strong part of this pantheon, due to her edict to survive at all costs and her abhorrence for the creation of unwilling undead.

Cayden Cailean reminds them every person deserves to live a life free of oppressive restrains, as well as a little leisure occasionally to lighten their loads.

As gods, they met Sarenrae, another goddess of the sun, and for a time, all four worked together to help the people of Golarion. Eventually, whether intentionally or otherwise, the people of Mzali forgot their sun gods. The sun gods watched as the people of Mzali forgot prayers and songs to their former gods.

While the sun gods appreciate this renewed faith, they did not forget Sarenrae's kindness. When asked about their disappearance, the sun gods merely state they were biding their time alongside a friend. This friendship led to the worship of the three sun gods alongside Sarenrae as a greater sun pantheon. The collective sun gods teach that kindness and second chances are pivotal values. They also note that sometimes a person needs to change into someone new before they are truly themselves and instruct that helping others with these changes is akin to helping bring new life into the world. The four gods know that there might be other forgotten gods and peoples out there that just need some kindness to make it through their period of turmoil, so they ask their worshippers to help these forgotten in whatever way they can. Finally, the sun gods make it clear that lost or abandoned gods can still find companionship among the divine and welcome these gods to join their ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> help others with changes that can improve their lives, mind those that others forget or exclude, offer second chances, stand up for others when they can't stand for themselves</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> challenge the sun, ignore the pleas of others when you are able to help, refuse to give someone else a chance to offer their truth</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> compassion, rebirth, and the sun</p>\n<p><strong>Pantheon Members</strong> Chohar, Luhar, Sarenrae, Tlehar</p>"

This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from Abadar's well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke Alseta the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as Tanagaar the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night. Adherents to this pantheon also look to Alseta for guidance in making their cities open and welcoming to all peaceful dwellers therein and for wisdom through the many transitions of urban life; they strive to follow her edict of treating all other beings with courtesy and respect. From Korada, they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples. Their shrines often skew toward the simple, as the Urban Prosperity tends to distribute any money it raises to those causes that promote peace and bring prosperity to all.

His twisting tail churns the air into clouds, his creations spreading water to all those who thirst. His sliding scales till the earth, bringing forth plants that are nourished by Uvuko's rains. The worship of Uvuko is widespread in the Mwangi Expanse, found among many lizardfolk tribes, Mbe'ke and Taralu dwarves, and in the more cosmopolitan cities.</p>\n<p>Uvuko's followers agree on the ideal of change as an aspect of life, both for themselves and others. Much as Uvuko's constant motion brings renewal to the earth and sky, personal growth and choice allows the world to flourish. When creatures are denied their ability to choose, their energy is lost, and the great cycle of the world threatens to halt. For this reason, adherents of Uvuko adamantly oppose slavery and servitude, and readily fight to end either. Sickness likewise causes a creature to stagnate and rot, and so worshippers often train as healers, helping others to shed their illness like a snake sheds its skin.</p>\n<p>Uvuko's worshippers also agree on the paramount importance of looking to the future with an unflinching attitude of eagerness and expectation. The past is the earth to be tilled, the future the endless potential of the empty sky. Evolving into a better self, being prepared for whatever is around the corner, and being self-aware are at the heart of Uvuko's teachings.

Ages later, his preserved body was found by members of the Council of Mwanyisa, who ruled Mzali at that time. Believing him to be an omen of the city's impending resurgence, the council took him to put him on display in Mzali.

Paradoxically, however, he is unable to manifest in the mortal universe unless summoned, a magical act that almost always results in untold destruction. He is known as the Key and the Gate, and magicians and cults research him in an effort to master time and space. Fortunately, his worship is not widespread, but some of those who have delved deep into his secrets describe him as an ambivalent figure, rather than a malevolent one, who guards cosmic secrets and makes them accessible to those who dare to ask for them.

			"description": "<p>Throughout the Mwangi, there are few as highly respected as storytellers. As stewards of their peoples' oral traditions, they act as historians, educators, and entertainers, so it is only right that they pay homage to the goddess of stories, Grandmother Spider. Also known as Nana Anadi, Grandmother Spider was once content in her role as weaver of fate for the gods, as it gave her the ability to craft the grandest tales anyone had ever known. But as she told story after story at the other gods' whims, they failed to show proper respect to the one who made their glorious and terrible legends come to pass, treating her as a servant or a tool. Grandmother had no patience for overinflated egos, and even less for those who take credit for the work of others. She crafted unique humiliations tailored to each of the gods, and as tales of her mischief spread, she wove her own divinity from them. Some of the more prideful gods deny her still-worshiping Grandmother Spider is forbidden by Asmodeus for as long as she still twirls copies of his keys around her fingers, and Abadar still holds a grudge since the Century of the Unbalanced Scale. To the north of the Mwangi, there are almost no shrines dedicated to Grandmother Spider. But the clever and willful always find ways to revere her.</p>\n<p>No matter how their pride might be wounded, few have dared to take direct action against Grandmother Spider. Alone, she is dangerous enough, for they say Nana Anadi holds all the secrets of the world within her web. However, her sibling Achaekek, the Red Mantis, is a force that even gods fear. Though he treats his sister with indifference, he once lashed out at someone who sought to do Grandmother Spider harm with disproportionate retribution. That one act has been more than enough.</p>\n<p>Grandmother Spider uplifts those who rebel against the status quo, strike above their station, or otherwise fight for freedom. While she prefers subterfuge and cleverness, she does not eschew violence, viewing it as simply another tool-applied judiciously in the right place at the right time, it can accomplish a great deal. Abolitionists and freedom fighters across Mwangi view spiders as an omen of good fortune. Those who are forced to live and fight in secret against their oppressors take great comfort in the knowledge that Nana Anadi will still tell their stories long after they are gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> be skilled and clever, think for yourself, take due payment for your work, humiliate the powerful</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> abuse someone you have power over, harm someone who has given you sincere kindness, let a slight go unanswered, own a slave</p>"
