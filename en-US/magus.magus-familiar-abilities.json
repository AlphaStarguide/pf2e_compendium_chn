			"name": "Constructed Weapon",
			"description": "<p>Your black blade can be wielded as a weapon and takes the form of a weapon of your choice during your daily preparations. Your black blade cannot be targeted by effects or given Commands while you are wielding it, but it may gain reactions it can use while it is being wielded depending on its abilities. You can etch runes and apply special materials to your black blade, but any property runes that can’t apply to the form of your black blade are suppressed until the item takes a shape to which they can apply. Your black blade is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, doomed, drained, fatigued, healing, necromancy, nonlethal attacks, paralyzed, poison, sickened, and unconscious. It can recover Hit Points only via the Repair action and other methods that fix items, not from any form of Hit Point healing. It's destroyed at 0 HP.</p>"

			"description": "<p>Your black blade has needs that it must fill, and you must satisfy its undying thirst for power. Your black blade gains an Ego value equal to its Will DC. Whenever you attempt an action that your black blade restricts, either by an ability or via violating its purpose, you must attempt a basic @Check[type:will|dc:resolve(@actor.system.saves.will.dc)] save against your black blade’s ego value or you lose Hit Points equal to your level and your weapon regains Hit Points equal to the Hit Points you lost. If you get a success, you do not have to make Will saves against your black blade’s ego for 1 hour, or 1 day if you got a critical success.</p>"

You can spend a single action with the concentrate trait to give your black blade the effects of Invigorate, but you must attempt a Will save against its Ego and you must attempt this save even if you would be immune to its Ego. Your familiar must be a black blade to select this ability.</p>"
