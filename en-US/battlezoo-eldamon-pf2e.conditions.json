            "description": "<p>Electricity eldamon and electricity elemental avatars can gain the charged condition. The charged condition always has a value, from 1 to 3. If a charged creature is already charged and would become charged, they instead increase the value of their charged condition by 1 to a maximum of charged 3. A charged creature is @UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-eldamon-pf2e.conditions.Item.1fZbuJEbVmE3J4XL]{Shocked} as long as it is charged. Any effect that would remove the shocked condition instead reduces the charged condition value by 1. Most electricity powers offer options to discharge, reducing the charged condition by 1, in order to gain additional effects.</p>\n<p>The charged condition lasts until the end of an encounter; any charge gained outside an encounter is lost during the next refresh. As a result, electricity eldamon and elemental avatars always begin an encounter uncharged. An electricity eldamon or elemental avatar can't use a power (or an optional benefit within a power) that requires them to discharge if they aren't charged.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Whenever you roll initiative, Refresh your powers in an encounter, or phase in if you're a water eldamon, choose high or low tide. This is your initial tide. Whenever you use a water power, you gain the effect of your current tide, then switch to the other tide (high tide becomes low tide, or low tide becomes high tide). In this way, you alternate your powers between the tides, until you refresh and change to whichever tide you prefer. You normally do not have a tide outside an encounter.</p>"

A frozen creature's body is slowly freezing over, causing it to take a status penalty to its Speeds equal to –5-feet × the frozen value, for instance –20-feet for frozen 4.</p>\n<p>A frozen creature or an adjacent ally can spend an Interact action to remove the ice, reducing the frozen condition by 4. A creature with the fire trait instead reduces its (or its ally's) frozen condition by 5. A creature using an effect with the fire trait, or an effect that would deal fire damage, on a frozen creature can choose to reduce the frozen creature's frozen value by 4, whether the creature takes any fire damage or not.</p>\n<p>While the frozen condition is normally not cumulative (like other conditions), ice eldamon and elemental avatars have a special ability allowing them to accumulate the frozen condition from their own powers.</p>"

            "name": "Limned",
            "description": "<p>Light power and effects might give a creature the limned condition. A limned creature is surrounded by light, causing it to glow like a torch, outlining it and making its position obvious. A limned creature can't normally become concealed, due to the glowing light, though if the creature would otherwise be invisible, they become concealed instead. An invisible creature concealed while limned can't use the concealed condition to Hide or Sneak, as the lights give its exact location away. The limned condition doesn't prevent a creature with cover from Hiding or Sneaking. If a creature has the ability to Hide or Sneak without cover or concealment (such as by using camouflage), the shining light from the limned condition makes that much more difficult as long as the light is visible, giving a –4 circumstance penalty to the creature's Stealth check, as well as to its Stealth DCs against the Seek action.</p>\n<p>A @UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-eldamon-pf2e.conditions.Item.SXQzSmgPZv0IFSlN]{Shrouded} creature that would become limned instead loses its shrouded condition, and vice versa.</p>"

            "description": "<p>Darkness powers and effects might give a creature the shrouded condition. The shrouded condition always has a value, from 1 to 3. The light surrounding a shrouded creature is occluded depending on the condition’s value and the level of light surrounding them. This affects the shrouded creature’s ability to see as well as other creatures’ ability to see the shrouded creature. Essentially the shrouded condition causes the light level to be a number of steps lower for the shrouded creature equal to the condition’s value (bright light to dim light, dim light to darkness, darkness to supernatural darkness akin to the 4th-rank <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4GE2ZdODgIQtg51c]{Darkness}</em> spell), except that shrouded 1 in dim light causes a creature to be concealed to low-light vision, rather than creating full darkness.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a creature gains a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak equal to the shrouded condition’s value. It’s possible to Hide and Sneak while shrouded by sinking into the shadows, but in a bright area, your general position might still be obvious due to the pall of darkness, in the same way as sneaking around with a visible aura around you might still give you away; in that case, you would be hidden instead of undetected.</p>\n<p>A shrouded creature that would become @UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-eldamon-pf2e.conditions.Item.5tWqbv3Iu1FlrOx6]{Limned} instead loses its shrouded condition, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>For a full description of how to apply the shrouded condition for every possible value of shrouded and every possible level of lighting, see the \"@UUID[JournalEntry.GfmgMfxWoAkjccTQ.JournalEntryPage.7A4XisITzN9KG7Qd#shrouded-full-examples]{Shrouded Full Examples}\" sidebar.</p>"
