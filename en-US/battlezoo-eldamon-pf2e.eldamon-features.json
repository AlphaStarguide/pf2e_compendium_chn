While using your air powers that allow you to Fly if you have a fly Speed, if you use the power on a solid surface, you can Fly up to your normal land Speed. If you end the movement somewhere that can't support your weight, such as in mid-air, you fall.</p><p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control air and wind in minor ways, allowing you to create or calm down light breezes. This can help cool you down in hot temperatures, similarly to wearing a warm weather outfit, make it harder to detect you via scent by making you downwind (unless the wind is blowing strongly in the other direction), and the like. At your GM's discretion, you can make other small adjustments to air and wind.</p><p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> The winds are your allies, never your adversaries. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against air effects and if you roll a success on your saving throw, you get a critical success instead. Wind that would normally be difficult terrain isn't difficult terrain for you, and wind that would normally be greater difficult terrain is only standard difficult terrain for you. If you have the Enhanced Resistance feat, your circumstance bonus against air effects increases to +2, wind that would normally be greater difficult terrain isn't difficult terrain at all for you, and if you roll a critical failure on a saving throw against an air effect, you get a failure instead.</p><p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can move and control air and wind to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to create enough wind to make an area difficult terrain for fliers or provide a –1 circumstance penalty to physical ranged attacks that move through the area, or slow down wind at a similar speed. When you sculpt, you affect roughly one 10-foot by 10-foot square or less, though the wind typically lasts 1 minute at most. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments to air and wind's shape or position.</p><p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> The wind carries all sorts of scents your way, granting you an extremely keen sense of smell. You gain scent as an imprecise sense out to 30 feet. As normal for scent, the range is typically reduced when you're upwind and increased when you're downwind.</p><p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> The shield also grants a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves.</p><p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> You Stride up to half your normal land Speed, fly up to half your normal fly Speed (if you have one), or Step.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> You can fly freely with the wind at your back.

While some find the darkness and the unknown terrifying and cruel, it can also be comforting, protecting from the harshness of the light. The darkness element also manipulates the shadows that form on the edges between light and darkness. Darkness eldamon and elemental avatars shroud themselves in shadows and darkness and manipulate them to keep their movements and intentions hidden.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Damage Type:</strong> Cold</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Traits:</strong> Darkness, Shadow</p>\n<h2>Darkness Key Terms</h2>\n<p>You’ll see the following term in many darkness elemental powers.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-eldamon-pf2e.conditions.Item.SXQzSmgPZv0IFSlN]{Shrouded}</strong>: Darkness powers and effects might give a creature the shrouded condition. The shrouded condition always has a value, from 1 to 3. The light surrounding a shrouded creature is occluded depending on the condition’s value and the level of light surrounding them. This affects the shrouded creature’s ability to see as well as other creatures’ ability to see the shrouded creature. Essentially the shrouded condition causes the light level to be a number of steps lower for the shrouded creature equal to the condition’s value (bright light to dim light, dim light to darkness, darkness to supernatural darkness akin to the 4th-rank darkness spell), except that shrouded 1 in dim light causes a creature to be concealed to low-light vision, rather than creating full darkness. Additionally, a creature gains a circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak equal to the shrouded condition’s value. It’s possible to Hide and Sneak while shrouded by sinking into the shadows, but in a bright area, your general position might still be obvious due to the pall of darkness, in the same way as sneaking around with a visible aura around you might still give you away; in that case, you would be hidden instead of undetected. A shrouded creature that would become limned instead loses its shrouded condition, and vice versa. For a full description of how to apply the shrouded condition for every possible value of shrouded and every possible level of lighting, see the following sidebar.</p>\n<h2>Shrouded Full Examples</h2>\n<p>If you're not sure of an interaction with the shrouded condition, the following are all possible combinations of shrouded values and light levels. The shrouded condition applies on top of the light level in the area, which could also be based on light and darkness spells and effects, but powers and abilities that grant shrouded are magical effects that have the darkness trait and can potentially be counteracted by effects with the light trait explicitly targeted against them. When it comes to light and darkness effects that don't explicitly target the source of the shrouded condition, apply all of those first to determine the true light level in the area, then use shrouded to see how well @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden} the shrouded creature is and how shrouded its vision has become. If a creature and its target are both shrouded, the conditions aren't cumulative; apply only the higher valued shrouded condition's effect.</p>\n<p>A creature that is shrouded 3 is shrouded in supernatural darkness, regardless of the light level or other light sources. If they have darkvision but not greater darkvision, everything around them is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} (and they can't see at all if they don't have darkvision), and if other creatures have darkvision but not greater darkvision, the shrouded creature is concealed (and they can't see the shrouded creature at all if they don't have darkvision).</p>\n<p>For a creature that's shrouded 2, the same effect applies unless they are in an area of bright light, in which case they are shrouded in normal darkness and can see normally if they have darkvision and other creatures can see them normally if they have darkvision.</p>\n<p>If the creature is only shrouded 1, the light level is one step lower (with a different effect for dim light), so in bright light, they're shrouded in dim light and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} except to creatures with low-light vision or darkvision, and everything is concealed to them unless they have low-light vision or darkvision; in dim light, the shadows deepen, causing them to be concealed except to creatures with darkvision, and everything is concealed to them unless they have darkvision; and in darkness, they're shrouded in supernatural darkness and concealed even to creatures with darkvision and everything is concealed to them even with darkvision.</p>\n<h2>Shrouding Foes</h2>\n<p>When you shroud a foe, it makes them difficult to see, in addition to making it harder for the foe to see. Think carefully about whether to choose powers that shroud foes based on whether your group has low-light vision, darkvision, and greater darkvision. At low levels, if your group doesn't have much of either, you might want to avoid the powers that shroud foes, while at higher levels, you can consider gaining darkvision options as a group (a good idea anyway) in order to take advantage of those powers.</p>\n<h2>Other Abilities</h2>\n<p>If your element is darkness, you gain the following abilities and effects from the Elemental Surge action, the Elemental Shield action, and the elemental avatar feats that vary by element.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Locomotion</strong> The shadows and darkness surround you while you move, making it easy for you to sneak around. Thanks to the darkness, you can Hide and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak} even without cover or being @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}, though the unnatural darkness and shadows that hide you might give you away, so you take a –2 penalty to your Stealth checks to do so. If you have the Legendary Sneak skill feat (or another ability that gives you the same benefit as Legendary Sneak, such as the goblin ancestry feat Very, Very Sneaky), you no longer take the penalty and instead gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to Hide and Sneak.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control darkness and shadows, slightly changing their configuration or giving yourself or a willing touched ally shrouded 1 for 1 round. At your GM's discretion, you can make other small adjustments to darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> You become protected against darkness and shadow. You gain resistance equal to half your level against damage from darkness and shadow effects and a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against such effects. If you have Enhanced Resistances, the circumstance bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can move and control darkness and shadows to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to twist and shape shadows like shadow puppets, adjusting their position or appearance, in up to a 10-foot by 10-foot area within 20 feet. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments to darkness and shadows' shape or position.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> You gain greater darkvision, which allows you to see clearly even in areas of extreme darkness (such as from a 4th level darkness spell or shrouded 3).</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> While your Elemental Shield is raised, the flat check to target you when you're concealed increases from 5 to 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> You or the chosen willing creature become shrouded 1 until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> You can transport from shadow to shadow, from patch of darkness to patch of darkness. If you're in an area of dim light or darkness (the shrouded condition isn't sufficient), as a single action, which has the move and teleportation traits, you can sink into the shadows and then reappear in another space in dim light or darkness within 30 feet. You still need line of effect to the space, but you don't need to cross the intervening squares, allowing you to avoid obstacles and hazardous terrain, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.</p>"

    "Death Element": {
      "name": "Death Element",
      "description": "<p>The element of death represents the end of life, part of the natural cycle. Death powers represent the end, so they weaken and kill living things and undead alike. Because death powers have the death trait, they kill their targets outright, rather than leave them unconscious and alive. As undying incarnations of natural elements, eldamon aren't killed by death powers, though they're still harmed and depleted as normal for other damaging effects. This is fortunate when it comes to eldamon battles, as otherwise death eldamon would be banned from competing.</p>\n<p><strong>Final End:</strong> Death powers deal void damage to living creatures, draining away their life, but they deal force damage to undead instead, losing the death and void traits against undead. Even so, undead are sometimes immune to some of a death power's additional effects, such as instant death effects. Creatures neither alive nor dead, such as constructs, are beyond the reach of the death element.</p>\n<p><strong>Life Drain:</strong> Death powers take advantage of creatures with weakened life force, dealing more damage to those who are already drained. Whenever a death power applies the drained condition to a creature that's already drained, the drained creature takes additional void damage equal to its level multiplied by the lower of its existing drained condition and the new drained condition. For example, if a 9th-level creature with drained 2 would be drained 1 by a death power, it takes 9 additional void damage, and if a 7th-level creature with drained 2 would be drained 3 by a death power, it takes 14 additional void damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Damage Type:</strong> Void</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Traits:</strong> Void</p>\n<h2>Prepare to Die!</h2>\n<p>Death eldamon and their powers can be scary for some foes, especially Inexorable Demise, with its visible countdown. Just like in any situation, the GM can choose to grant circumstance bonuses or penalties to certain types of actions taken in conjunction with death powers. For instance, it might be easier to Coerce someone with Quick Coerce if you're out of combat and they're under the effect of Inexorable Demise. As always, the GM determines when to grant these benefits.</p>\n<h2>Other Abilities</h2>\n<p>If your element is death, you gain the following abilities and effects from the Elemental Surge action, the Elemental Shield action, and the elemental avatar feats that vary by element.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Locomotion</strong> You can surround yourself with death energy as you move, forcing foes to get out of your way or suffer the consequences. As a single action, you can Stride while swathed in death energy. During this movement, you can attempt to move through a foe's space. The foe has a choice: they can either allow you to move through their space, or they can prevent your movement, taking 1 void damage plus 1 void damage for each level you have, with a basic Fortitude save. If a foe chooses to prevent your movement in this way, your movement immediately ends, even if you still had more distance you could travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control death in minor ways, allowing you to increase or decrease a creature's dying value by up to 2 or kill a tiny non-creature plant with just a touch. At your GM's discretion, you can make other small adjustments involving death, though this is never sufficient to kill a creature that isn't already dying.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Your body becomes resistant to death's call. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against death effects and gain resistance equal to half your level against void damage. If you have the Enhanced Resistance feat, your circumstance bonus against death effects increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can bring to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to kill noncreature plants in an area roughly one 10-foot by 10-foot square or less up to 20 feet away or to kill a dying creature. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments involving death and killing, though it's still insufficient to kill a creature that isn't already dying.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> You can sense how close a creature is to death. Just by looking at a creature, you can tell if they are healthy (above 3/4 Hit Points), hurt (between half and 3/4 Hit Points), injured (between 1/4 and half Hit Points) or at death's door (below 1/4 Hit Points). A creature actively attempting to disguise its life force or level of injury can attempt a Deception check against your Perception DC as normal, but otherwise your sense works without needing to attempt a check.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> The shield also grants a +1 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> The chosen creature is enfeebled 1 or clumsy 1 (your choice) for 1 round unless they succeed at a Fortitude save against your power DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> Your connection to death allows you to appear by the side of recently or nearly dead creatures, almost like a psychopomp or harbinger of doom. As a single action, which has the move trait, you can briefly transition into death energy and then reappear in a space adjacent to any creature that is dying or has died in the past minute within 60 feet. You still need line of effect to the creature and you must be able to detect them with a precise sense, but you don't need to cross the intervening squares, allowing you to avoid obstacles and hazardous terrain, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.</p>"

A charged creature is shocked as long as it is charged. Any effect that would remove the shocked condition instead reduces the charged condition value by 1. Most electricity powers offer options to discharge, reducing the charged condition by 1, in order to gain additional effects. The charged condition lasts until the end of an encounter; any charge gained outside an encounter is lost during the next refresh. As a result, electricity eldamon and elemental avatars always begin an encounter uncharged.

If your destination contains an object or creature of significant size that substantially conducts electricity (such as copper, silver, or gold), you can move up to your land Speed instead of half your land Speed. If you end the movement somewhere that can't support your weight, such as in mid-air, you fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control electricity and electric current, diverting electric currents or electric charge. You can also give an adjacent creature the shocked condition for 2 rounds. At your GM's discretion, you can make other small adjustments to electricity.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Your body becomes protected against electric surges, as the energy within you diverts hostile electricity.

You gain resistance equal to half your level against electricity damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can move and control electricity to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to channel significant electric current and even direct nearby environmental electricity to another target of your choice. For instance, if a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm (not a spell, power, or other ability) was about to hit a tree, you could divert it to a nearby foe instead. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments to electricity's shape or position.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> You gain imprecise voltsense out to 30 feet, which allows you to sense electric potential and currents. Not only does it allow you to notice electric power moving around you, it can potentially allow you to notice most living creatures, as they rely on electric currents to power their nervous systems. However, the electric current from a living creature is quite small and easily hidden amidst the various currents in the environment, even if a creature isn't taking precautions against voltsense. Stronger electricity, on the other hand, is almost impossible to hide from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> If a foe misses their melee attack only because of the Elemental Shield's circumstance bonus to AC, the shield zaps the foe, and they become shocked until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> The chosen creature becomes shocked until the end of your next turn unless they succeed at a Reflex save against your power DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> You can chain the lightning jolts from your elemental locomotion zigzagging through conductive materials like chain lightning. As long as you continue using lightning jolts to move at least once per turn, you don't fall until the end of your next turn, even if you end your movement in mid-air.

If you end the movement somewhere that can't support your weight, such as in mid-air, you can take a single additional action that doesn't have the move trait, or use a single active fire power, before falling.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can call and control flames in minor ways, allowing you to create small sparks from your fingers that can ignite flammable objects, move very small flames, or put out candles and other extremely small fires by touch. At your GM's discretion, you can make other small adjustments to fires.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Your body becomes inured to flames and heat. You are protected from severe environmental heat and gain resistance equal to half your level against fire damage. If you have the Enhanced Resistance feat, you also become protected against extreme environmental heat.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can move and control flames to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation.

    "Ice Element": {
      "name": "Ice Element",
      "description": "<p>The element of ice embodies the arctic chill of winter, ice, and snow. Thus, it focuses on powers that freeze and hamper enemies. While the frozen condition can't take away a foe's actions on its own, combined with movement and positioning, ice powers can put the foe in a position where it's forced to either spend an action removing the ice or moving twice, thanks to a reduced move speed. Ice users use these no-win situations to reduce their enemies' output, and they can learn other tricks to punish foes who choose to stay immobile, exploiting their high frozen value.</p>\n<p><strong>Ice Accumulation:</strong> While normally the frozen condition isn't cumulative, ice eldamon and ice elemental avatars can accumulate the frozen condition from their own powers to a maximum of 5 plus 1 for every 4 levels they have (maximum 10 at 20th level). This means that if a single elemental avatar causes a foe to gain the frozen 2 condition and then the frozen 3 condition, the foe becomes frozen 5. If two eldamon or elemental avatars both cause frozen conditions on the same creature, the values aren't cumulative.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Damage Type:</strong> Cold</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Traits:</strong> Cold</p>\n<h2>Ice Key Terms</h2>\n<p>You'll see the following term in almost every ice elemental power.</p>\n<p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.battlezoo-eldamon-pf2e.conditions.Item.OyojvmEKkLrUxX1W]{Frozen}:</strong> The frozen condition always has a value. A frozen creature's body is slowly freezing over, causing it to take a status penalty to its Speeds equal to –5-feet × the frozen value, for instance –20-feet for frozen 4. A frozen creature or an adjacent ally can spend an Interact action to remove the ice, reducing the frozen condition by 4. A creature with the fire trait instead reduces its (or its ally's) frozen condition by 5. A creature using an effect with the fire trait, or an effect that would deal fire damage, on a frozen creature can choose to reduce the frozen creature's frozen value by 4, whether the creature takes any fire damage or not. While the frozen condition is normally not cumulative (like other conditions), ice eldamon and elemental avatars have a special ability allowing them to accumulate the frozen condition from their own powers.</p>\n<h2>Interacting Without Hands</h2>\n<p>There is some ambiguity in the rules as to whether or not a creature without hands can use the Interact action; on the other hand, if they couldn't, it would be impossible for those creatures to remove the effect of bow critical specialization. In any case, for the purpose of the frozen condition, any creature can take the Interact action needed to remove frozen.</p>\n<h2>Other Abilities</h2>\n<p>If your element is ice, you gain the following abilities and effects from the Elemental Surge action, the Elemental Shield action, and the elemental avatar feats that vary by element.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Locomotion</strong> You freeze the water in the air beneath your feet, allowing you to momentarily walk on the air, before it thaws. Walking on this ice path is normally difficult terrain. When you Stride starting from a solid surface, you can move over thin air, ascending or descending at a maximum of a 45-degree angle, though after your Stride action is complete, if you aren't on a surface that can support your weight, you can take a single action that doesn't have the move trait or use an ice power and then you fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control cold and ice in minor ways, allowing you to chill an object or even freeze over or defrost a very small object, potentially providing momentary relief against environmental heat, slightly contracting chilled metal, making certain drinks tastier, and so on. At your GM's discretion, you can make other similar small adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Your body becomes accustomed to glacial chill. You are protected from severe environmental cold and gain resistance equal to half your level against cold damage. If you have the Enhanced Resistance feat, you also become protected against extreme environmental cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can sculpt and control ice and snow to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to create rough shapes and features out of ice and snow in the area, roughly one 10-foot by 10-foot square at a time out to 20 feet, potentially allowing for a larger sculpture over time. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments to ice, snow, and areas of magical cold.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> You can see through falling ice and snow as easily as through a clear sky. You can see through snow storms, ice storms, and the like. They don't impair your vision, and creatures who would be concealed only due to such precipitation aren't concealed to you. Additionally, you can see clearly through partially transparent sheets of ice that would otherwise conceal whatever was on the other side, but you can't see through solid opaque walls of ice or snow.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> If a foe misses their melee attack only because of the Elemental Shield's circumstance bonus to AC, the shield freezes the foe, and they become frozen 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> The chosen creature becomes frozen 2 unless they succeed at a Reflex save against your power DC, or frozen 1 on a success. They aren't frozen on a critical success.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> When you freeze the air beneath you to support your weight, a stable platform of ice remains frozen beneath your feet until you step away. This allows you to walk on the air and remain in mid-air as long as you wish.</p>"

If you have Siphoning Element class feature, you gain the Battle Medicine skill feat and can use your life powers to Treat Wounds and provide Battle Medicine with your powers and without a healer's kit; when you use Treat Wounds and Battle Medicine in this way, on a success the target recovers additional Hit Points equal to your level, and the target becomes temporarily immune to Battle Medicine for only 1 hour, not 1 day. At your GM's discretion, you can make other similar small adjustments to life force.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Your body becomes bolstered by life energy, protecting you from dying.

While you're moving, foes who use a reaction or free action against you are momentarily dazzled while resolving their reaction or free action.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control light, calling forth a light and attaching it to a creature or object, or letting it float in mid-air, with the effects of a light cantrip. At your GM's discretion, you can make other small adjustments to light.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> You become protected against light. You gain resistance equal to half your level against damage from light effects and a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against such effects, as well as any effect that would make you dazzled or blinded. If you have Enhanced Resistances, the circumstance bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can move and control light to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to twist and shape light into various forms, adjusting their position or appearance, in up to a 10-foot by 10-foot area within 20 feet. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments to light's shape or position.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> The light reveals hidden secrets around you. When you come within 10 feet of a hidden object, creature, or secret door, the GM rolls an automatic secret Perception check for you to find it, even if you aren't Searching. This doesn't help you find or identify traps, haunts, and other hazards, only objects, creatures, and secret doors.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> If a foe misses their melee attack only because of the Elemental Shield's circumstance bonus to AC, the shield dazzles the foe with light, and they become dazzled until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> The chosen creature becomes limned until the end of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> You can move in a straight line with the speed of light, like a ray of light. If you Stride (or use another form of movement if you have it) in a straight line, you can choose to do so at the speed of light. If you do, creatures and hazards can't use reactions or free actions against you unless they can react faster than the speed of light, and you can run up walls or other vertical surfaces, as long as you end your movement on a surface that can support you.</p>"

    "Water Element": {
      "name": "Water Element",
      "description": "<p>The element of water embodies the rush and constant change of currents and the ebb and flow of the tides. Just as water exists in a cycle, as a water user, if you learn to make the most of the changing tides, you can take control of the battlefield.</p>\n<p><strong>Current's Pull:</strong> Allies don't take damage from your water powers if they're in the area (or if you choose to target them), and they can choose any of the degrees of success from the power and allow the power to move them the appropriate distance. For instance, if you power doesn't move a creature on a critical success, pushes them 10 feet on a success, pushes them 20 feet on a failure, and pushes them 40 feet on a critical failure, your ally can choose to stay where they are or to be pushed 10, 20, or 40 feet (though the rushing water is too rapid for precise control, so they can't choose any distances in between).</p>\n<p><strong>Shifting Tides:</strong> Whenever you roll initiative, Refresh your powers in an encounter, or phase in if you're a water eldamon, choose high or low tide. This is your initial tide. Whenever you use a water power, you gain the effect of your current tide, then switch to the other tide (high tide becomes low tide, or low tide becomes high tide). In this way, you alternate your powers between the tides, until you refresh and change to whichever tide you prefer. You normally do not have a tide outside an encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Underwater Bludgeoner:</strong> Bludgeoning water powers manipulate the water itself, so they don't take penalties underwater, even if they involve melee or ranged attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Damage Type:</strong> Bludgeoning</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Traits:</strong> Water</p>\n<h2>Water Key Terms</h2>\n<p>You'll see one or both of the following terms in almost every water elemental power. Typically, a water power has a special effect depending on if you are at high or low tide when you use it.</p>\n<p><strong>High Tide:</strong> At high tide, your powers push heedlessly outward, ready to break the shore. Any time a water power says it \"moves\" an enemy, if you're in high tide, you push the enemy directly away from you unless stated otherwise. High tide powers tend to deal additional damage, but they often come with a defensive drawback of some kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Low Tide:</strong> At low tide, your powers ebb back protectively toward you. Any time a water power says it \"moves\" an enemy, if you're in low tide, you pull the enemy directly toward you unless stated otherwise. Low tide powers tend to pull enemies toward you, and their damage is lower than at high tide, but they often come with a defensive benefit of some kind.</p>\n<h2>Other Abilities</h2>\n<p>If your element is water, you gain the following abilities and effects from the Elemental Surge action, the Elemental Shield action, and the elemental avatar feats that vary by element.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Locomotion</strong> You gain a swim Speed equal to your land Speed (or vice versa if you're an aquatic creature that normally doesn't have a land Speed) and can breathe underwater (or breathe air if you're an aquatic creature). If you're in high tide, you gain a +10-foot status bonus to your swim Speed, and if you're in low tide, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC against reactions triggered by your movement while swimming.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control water around you in minor ways, allowing you to move and filter small amounts of water, condense moisture in the air in a humid area into water, evaporate small amounts of water, and perform other similar actions as determined by the GM.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Your body is protected from and by water. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against water effects and gain resistance equal to half your level against water damage. If you have the Enhanced Resistance feat, your circumstance bonus on saving throws against water effects increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can sculpt water, allowing you to move substantial amounts of water (up to 40 Bulk) located up to 20 feet away and taking up no larger than a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot space up to 20 feet. You can also sculpt the water's form into fanciful shapes, though if the water doesn't have a container, it will splash into a puddle soon after you stop sculpting it.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> You notice tremors in the water around you. You gain wavesense as an imprecise sense out to 60 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> The shield also gives you resistance to acid and fire equal to half your level while it lasts. For water eldamon, the resistance to fire is cumulative with their base resistance.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> You can push (if you're in high tide) or pull (if you're in low tide) the chosen creature 10 feet unless they succeed at a Fortitude save against your power DC. Since the Elemental Surge action isn't a power, using it doesn't shift your tide.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> By calling forth tides of water around you, you can swim on land and in the air. You can use your swim Speed to Swim on land and into the air. When you do, you call a personal wave of water that carries you along as you Swim. If you're in a location that can't hold your weight, such as in midair, you fall at the end of your turn if you don't Swim at least once during your turn.</p>"

    "Wood Element": {
      "name": "Wood Element",
      "description": "<p>The element of wood embodies natural growth, as seen all across the plant kingdom. Thus, it focuses on powers that grow, building up by sowing plants across the battlefield in order to harvest the plants later for a greater effect. Wood users learn to follow the natural cycle of growth and balance their sowing and harvesting for maximum effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Damage Type:</strong> Piercing</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Traits:</strong> Plant, Wood</p>\n<h2>Wood Key Terms</h2>\n<p>You’ll see one or both of the following terms in almost every wood elemental power. Typically, a wood power gives you the choice to sow or harvest.</p>\n<p><strong>Sow:</strong> When you choose to sow, you cause temporary foliage or other plants to sprout either in a location listed in the power, or in the power's area by default. You sow plants on the ground. Areas with these plants are always difficult terrain and might have different effects depending on the power, and the plants last either until you harvest them, until they are destroyed, or until you refresh, whichever comes first. Area of effect fire or ice damage destroys the plants you sowed in the area. You can sow plants in an area that already naturally has plants, but if you sow plants in an area that you already sowed plants, there's no additional effect; if one or both of the sowed plants had an additional effect depending on the power, you can choose one of the effects to keep in the overlapping area, but not both.</p>\n<p><strong>Harvest:</strong> You can only choose to harvest either in an area you've already sown plants or in an area that has thick enough natural vegetation to cause difficult terrain; otherwise, you must choose to sow with your power. You can't use plants sown by other creature's spells or abilities. If you harvest plants sown from your wood powers, they vanish, and if you harvest from natural vegetation, the vegetation remains, but you can't harvest from it again for 24 hours, as the plant's elemental wood energy replenishes. Normally, when you harvest for a power, that power grants you a special benefit for harvesting, but some powers indicate that the plants you sow with them have an additional benefit when harvested. In that case, you gain both benefits when harvesting that plant.</p>\n<h2>Other Abilities</h2>\n<p>If your element is wood, you gain the following abilities and effects from the Elemental Surge action, the Elemental Shield action, and the elemental avatar feats that vary by element.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Locomotion</strong> The plants get out of your way, allowing you to move through them with ease. You ignore any difficult or greater difficult terrain caused by plants and fungi, such as bushes, vines, and undergrowth. Even plants and fungi manipulated by magic don't impede your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Manipulation</strong> When you use Elemental Manipulation, you can control non-creature plants around you in minor ways, allowing you to help them grow healthily, cause buds or flowers to open, make the plant wilt, and so on. At your GM's discretion, you can make other similar small adjustments.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Resistance</strong> Plants pull their punches against you. You gain resistance equal to half your level to damage from plant creatures and effects with the plant or wood traits. If you have the Enhanced Resistance feat, plant creatures with an Intelligence of –4 or –5 normally won't attack you unless compelled to do so by another creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Sculptor</strong> When you use the Elemental Sculptor feat, you can sculpt and control the position of plants to a greater extent than Elemental Manipulation. This allows you to create rough shapes and features out of plants in the area, roughly one 10-foot by 10-foot square at a time within 20 feet, potentially allowing for a larger sculpture over time, and also allows you to move around plants providing difficult terrain or cover to clear a path or create obstructions, including plants you sow with your wood powers. At the GM's discretion, you can make other similar adjustments to plants.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Senses</strong> You gain greensight, which allows you to see through living plants (though not wooden walls, doors, and the like) as if they were semi-transparent, allowing you to view what's on the other side.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Shield</strong> If there's a plant you can harvest in your space (or one of your spaces if you are Large or Larger), you can harvest all plants in your space as a free action when a foe attacks you and would hit your AC exactly, to increase the circumstance bonus to AC to 2, or 3 if you are an elemental avatar holding the elemental shield. The increased circumstance bonus applies to your AC when you're determining the outcome of the triggering attack, which normally makes the attack miss.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Surge</strong> You sow in either a 5-foot emanation or a 5-foot burst within 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Locomotion</strong> When you create plants using your powers, you can transform yourself into wood elemental energy to transport between them. As a single action, which has the move trait, you can briefly transition into wood energy and then reappear in a space where you sowed a plant with your power, or an adjacent space; either way, the space must be within 60 feet. You still need line of effect to the plant and you must be able to detect the plant with a precise sense, but you don't need to cross the intervening squares, allowing you to avoid obstacles and hazardous terrain, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions based on movement.</p>"
