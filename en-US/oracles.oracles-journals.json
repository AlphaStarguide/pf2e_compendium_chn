Whatever the reason, you spend your life one step closer to your curses effects and in exchange, when you push your curse to its limits, your mind and body is awakened to divine power.</p><p>You are under the effects of your minor curse at all times even after your daily preparations and you can never lower the stage of their curse below this stage.
