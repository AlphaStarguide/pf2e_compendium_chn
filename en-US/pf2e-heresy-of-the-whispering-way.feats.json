You gain the following benefits:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Arm Wands </strong>You can store up to two wands in the radius and ulna of one of your arms. These wands can be used as if wielded, and cannot be disarmed. If an arm wand is overcharged, you take @Damage[20] damage if the wand is broken or @Damage[40] if it’s destroyed. You can exchange one of these wands for another wand on your person during your daily preparations.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stored Weapon </strong>You carve several runes into the bones of your arms (typically the arm without the arm wands), allowing you to link a single weapon to it and store it in an extradimensional space. Over the course of a week (or upon first gaining this feat), you can bind a weapon that you are at least trained in to this arm. It gains the invested and magical trait if it didn’t have it already. When you would Draw or Stow a Weapon while the weapon is invested, you can instead summon this weapon to your hand or dismiss it back to its extradimensional storage. You dismiss the weapon from any distance, so long as you are on the same plane.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When making an attack with a weapon bound to you in this manner,  you may use your @Check[type:spell-attack] modifier instead of your weapon attack modifier; when doing so, you do not add your Strength or Dexterity to the damage. Additionally, if you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-heresy-of-the-whispering-way.feats.Item.PjwVieTk1EJJNwve]{Hand of the Lich} feat, the weapon attack deals additional damage equal to half the number of dice from your fist attack (minimum 1), and you may have the weapon use your fist’s critical specialization effect instead of its own. For the purposes of any other feats such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-heresy-of-the-whispering-way.feats.Item.7fjW0SkbWUFimN7s]{Siphon Life}, an attack with this weapon counts as a fist attack.</p>",
