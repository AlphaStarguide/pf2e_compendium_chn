Thankfully for the city's inhabitants, protective walls and magical forecasts have largely mitigated the most troublesome aspects of spellcasting within the City of Smog. Naturally, however, the same can't be said for the vast, haunted wastes beyond the city's borders.</p>\n<p>In this adventure, the characters step foot outside the relative safety of the city of Alkenstar and into the perilous Spellscar Desert, one of the Mana Wastes' most magically disturbed subregions. Here as never before, they'll encounter dangerous, terrifying, and downright strange places and denizens. For many, the outright weirdness of the Mana Wastes is exactly what makes the place so appealing.</p>\n<p>Chapter 2 of \"Cradle of Quartz\" includes numerous bizarre situations and encounters for the party to overcome, and the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17905thespe.JournalEntryPage.05spellscardes00]{Spellscar Desert} article includes dozens more whimsical characters, locations, and ideas for you to seed into the party's wasteland wanderings as you like. Of course, you should feel free to drop in your own outlandish ideas, too. In fact, if you've been waiting for a chance to incorporate your wildest, wackiest ideas into a Pathfinder Adventure Path, the party's foray into the Spellscar is a prime opportunity.</p>\n</aside>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Chapter 1: The High Priest's Puzzle</span></h2>\n<p>After learning a high priest of Brigh reverse-engineered the formula for @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06pyronite000000]{Pyronite}, the player characters track down the missing man to determine what kind of formula, exactly, was leaked to their adversaries.

To figure out where the cleric is, the party investigates his trap-laden workshop. </p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Chapter 2: Searching the Spellscar</span></h2>\n<p>Oloman Kosowana fled to the Cradle of Quartz, a remote Brighite shrine in the middle of the Spellscar Desert, east of Alkenstar.

When a freak mana storm brings the airship crashing into the desert sands, the characters must travel through the cursed desert on foot.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Chapter 3: The Cradle of Quartz</span></h2>\n<p>Within the crystalline Brighite shrine called the Cradle of Quartz, the player characters encounter monstrous adversaries and confounding puzzles as they search for Oloman Kosowana.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Chapter 4: The Steaming Kingdom</span></h2>\n<p>The party returns to Alkenstar to face their old adversary, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06ambrostmugla00]{Ambrost Mugland}.

the previous volume, Foebe Dunsmith hires the player characters to track down a high priest of Brigh named Oloman Kosowana, who apparently managed to reverse-engineer the pyronite formula. The objective isn't to stop the spread of the formula but to perform damage control. The party's best lead is Alkenstar's Temple of Brigh, where the characters can meet Kosowana's contemporaries and learn the location of his private workshop. At the workshop, the characters learn they're too late: Kosowana fled Alkenstar, and Ambrost Mugland's goons ransacked his home. Among the workshop ruins lies a spark of Kosowana's genius, however, in the form of a clue to the high priest's hiding spot in the Spellscar Desert: a long-forgotten Brighite shrine called the Cradle of Quartz.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>Oloman Kosowana's life has taken some strange turns. His early years as a tinkerer and inventor led him to join Alkenstar's Temple of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.vEMCpm7iidycRT5D]{Brigh} as a young man, and he devoted himself to research and invention at the Bronze Lady's direction. After decades of service to the church, he rose to the rank of primary cog, a position equivalent to high priest or priestess in other organized religions. The expectation was that he would either stay in Alkenstar to serve under the local church's leader, Grand Cog Athenth Llanalir, or migrate to another part of the world to spread the faith and start his own congregation.</p>\n<p>Instead, Kosowana defied expectations by remaining in Alkenstar yet dedicating his time and efforts to researching and compiling some of the church's more rebellious elements. Well-established doctrines couldn't captivate his ever-curious mind, and so he delved deeper and deeper into the church's archives in search of mysteries, secrets, and forgotten lore. In the process, he came across many documents and texts not only unavailable to rank-and-file worshippers, but for all intents and purposes totally proscribed from Brighite orthodoxy.</p>\n<p>Brigh's faith opposes the destruction of knowledge, but the church leaders recognize not all information is of equal value or veracity. Many Brighite documents of questionable content are sequestered beneath Alkenstar's Temple of Brigh in a dusty sub-basement called the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17901thehig.JournalEntryPage.01theasynchron00]{The Asynchronous Archives}. Kosowana immersed himself in the rescinded legends and parables of the early church of Brigh, and he came to believe the current clergy lost their \"true path\" long ago. Outlandish theories, alternate histories, and falsehoods'both deliberate and accidental'all pushed conventional wisdom from Kosowana's belief system, triggering his crisis of faith. He left the formal structure of his church and began to seek even more esoteric sources of knowledge from independent researchers, putting together disparate sources into a patchwork quilt of conspiracy.</p>\n\n"},"The Conspiracy":{"name":"The Conspiracy","text":"\n<p>The heretical teachings of the Asynchronous Archives continued to resonate with Kosowana's fruitful imaginings long after he retired from the Temple of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.vEMCpm7iidycRT5D]{Brigh}. Central to Kosowana's alternative belief system is a formerly sacred location in the Spellscar Desert, a shrine called the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17903thecra.JournalEntryPage.03thecradleofq00]{The Cradle of Quartz}. Eccentric Brighite explorers discovered the location a century ago'an unusually pure outcropping of quartz crystals, Brigh's sacred stone'and chose the remote location to establish their small shrine.</p>\n<p>According to materials Kosowana unearthed in the Asynchronous Archives, the crystals at the Cradle of Quartz could be used to peer backward and forward in time. One extreme prophet'known in writing only as \"the 13th Ordinal\" claimed the Cradle of Quartz could be used not just to observe, but actually travel through time. To many in the church, such a concept was not only unbelievable, but antithetical to many of the precepts held sacred in the Brighite mainstream. Before the 13th Ordinal's radical ideas could gain purchase in the minds of susceptible followers, the Temple of Brigh branded these fringe beliefs the 'Concurrent Heresy\" and sealed away the relevant works in the deepest levels of the Asynchronous Archives.</p>\n<p>When Kosowana discovered these writings, he believed, like many before him, such outlandish claims must have a grain of truth to them. In truth, the 13th Ordinal was no seer or prophet, but a devious @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.sNEvW8qBxztZcI8p]{Shrine Skelm} called Droxolos the Eroder. Driven by the desire to undermine the Temple of Brigh in Alkenstar for his own amusement, Droxolos created the Concurrent Heresy from whole cloth. Not content to merely warp the minds and hearts of Brighites, Droxolos led his devotees on a secret pilgrimage to the Cradle of Quartz in 4688 ar.</p>\n<p>While the 13th Ordinal's texts were based on fantasy, cosmic powers exist that take seriously any attempts to abuse the sanctity of time, imagined or real. To many of these powers, the veracity of such ambitions is irrelevant; any who attempt to subvert the laws of nature deserve to be punished for their crimes, whether or not their efforts held any promise.</p>\n<p>When Droxolos and his flock arrived at the Cradle of Quartz and began their futile experiments, they drew the attention of a @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.JgePINrFINmlsvn3]{Hound Of Tindalos}, a foul aberration from the Dimension of Time, who responded to the Brighites' hubris by slaughtering them all. In a single night of terror, the monster cut down the Concurrent Heretics and ended their meddling. Those few pilgrims who traveled to the Cradle of Quartz afterward and returned alive told tales of bloodless wounds and claws of smoke that rent both flesh and space itself.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the massacre, the Temple of Brigh removed all references to the Cradle of Quartz and transferred related documents to the Asynchronous Archives. The temple issued a new edition of Brigh's holiest text, Logic of Design, and recalled the previous version (as is customary practice for Brighite doctrines). The orthodox elements of the Temple of Brigh keep the Cradle of Quartz's location a secret to prevent others from traveling down the same doomed, heretical path. Forsaken by the Temple of Brigh and unknown to most due to the dangers of the magic-warped desert surrounding it, the Cradle of Quartz has been undisturbed for more than a hundred years.</p>\n\n"},"Recent Events":{"name":"Recent Events","text":"\n<p>In his new life as a tinkerer and maker of clockwork devices, Oloman Kosowana was present at the recent @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06pyronite000000]{Pyronite} demonstration of his friend Vashon Gattlebee. Upon seeing the incredible new explosive in action, Kosowana immediately grasped the danger of such a substance becoming commonly available. He feared any idiot with a few gold coins could wield the destructive power of an expert evoker. Kosowana also realized the confirmed existence of a substance like pyronite would spark research into other destructive branches of alchemy, touching off an arms race that could shatter the tenuous technological balance in Alkenstar and beyond. The only way for the invention of pyronite to end in anything other than disaster, he hypothesized, would require the formula to be prohibitively difficult and expensive to manufacture. Ever the scientist, Kosowana set out to test whether this was the case.</p>\n<p>Armed only with the few technical details Gattlebee provided at his demonstration as well as his own expansive knowledge of alchemy, Kosowana worked to reverse-engineer the pyronite formula in his workshop in the Ferrous Quarter. As he worked, he felt as though his hands were guided by a power outside himself. He believed this thrilling bout of focus was the guidance of his former patron, @Compendium[pf2e.deities.vEMCpm7iidycRT5D]{Brigh}. In fact, the divine guidance came from another power, one that wanted to enable the scenario Kosowana sought to prevent. The malignant eldritch entity called @Compendium[pf2e.deities.3nxIpMGeCvcBIVov]{Nyarlathotep} saw in pyronite a fantastic opportunity to sow chaos throughout the mortal realm, so the Outer God subtly guided Kosowana's work to completion.</p>\n<p>Recently, Kosowana's final experiment resulted in a blast large enough to rattle windows for several blocks, informing those in the know that the pyronite formula was no longer restricted to its original discoverer. This information quickly made its way to the unscrupulous mogul @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06ambrostmugla00]{Ambrost Mugland}, who set plans in motion to \"collect\" Kosowana and his formula. Mugland was already heavily in debt over his pyronite schemes, but he managed to find two buyers for the formula. Mugland failed to capture Gattlebee, but this new development offered him a second chance for success, and he decided to go all in. He pushed his financial abilities to the limit and contracted with the infamous crime lord @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06saborasharko00]{Sabora Sharkosa's} gang, the Gilded Gunners, to track down Kosowana and retrieve both him and his version of the pyronite formula.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Time to Leave</h2>\n<p>When Kosowana saw how easily he reconstructed the pyronite formula -oblivious to Nyarlathotep's aid- he fell into deep despair. He felt he must prevent this terrible weapon from falling into anyone's hands; no one could be trusted with such unbridled destructive power. Recalling stories of the Cradle of Quartz that had he read in the Asynchronous Archives, Kosowana struck upon a wild, tenuous plan: by traveling to the Cradle of Quartz, he could turn back the hands of time and prevent the discovery of pyronite from occurring in the first place.</p>\n<p>The Gilded Gunners got to Kosowana before he could destroy his research. Kosowana managed to escape the gang's clutches and fled to the Cradle of Quartz. As soon as he arrived, he encountered the Hound of Tindalos, still present after all this time. He evaded the creature and holed up in the one area in the Cradle it cannot enter. Now, Kosowana vainly pursues his fool's errand to uncover the Cradle of Quartz's supposed secrets and alter the flow of time for the good of Golarion.</p>\n\n"},"Getting Started":{"name":"Getting Started","text":"\n<p>At the end of the previous adventure, \"Punks in a Powder Keg,\" the party of outlaw characters apprehended the small-time pyrotechnic alchemist Shoma Lyzerius, who'd hired a gang called the Powderkeg Punks to capture the alchemist Vashon Gattlebee. After his defeat, Lyzerius called the player characters fools for trying to keep the formula a secret. He then revealed that he'd heard another inventor had already successfully replicated the formula anyway. The party's employer, Foebe Dunsmith, was extremely dismayed by this news. </p>\n<p>After the party has a few days of downtime to recover, craft or purchase items, and pursue personal agendas throughout Alkenstar, they're approached by Dunsmith, who represents the interests of the grand duchess of Alkenstar. As has become standard for their get-togethers, Dunsmith arranges a meeting with the party in a private room at the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon. Dunsmith's tone is graver than usual as she explains that, despite the characters' best efforts, the formula for @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06pyronite000000]{Pyronite} appears to have been compromised.</p>\n<p>Read or paraphrase the following aloud to start this adventure and give the party their next mission.</p>\n<div class=\"read-aloud\">\n<p>\"Well, I have another problem that needs solving, and I think it's right up your alley,\" the gunslinging bartender sighs. \"It pays well, and it'll get you even closer to settling your score with your old friends Ambrost Mugland and Deputy Anjelique Loveless.</p>\n<p>Last night, we got reports of a flying clockwork monster spotted over Hammer Street in Ferrous Quarter. It flew over the Ustradi due east before leaving the city entirely.\"\" Dunsmith indicates the general area on a map of Alkenstar. \"One of the sentries at Alkenstar Castle got a good look at it and said it was a clockwork cat with big bronze wings, with somebody riding it like a steed.\"</p>\n<p>\"We checked with the Temple of Brigh-you know, goddess of clockworks. They keep a tight rein on which clockworks get made in Alkenstar. Turns out nobody's filed the paperwork for any clockwork cats. According to the Brighites, there's just one obvious suspect. Dunsmith slides a charcoal sketch across the table. The sketch shows a gaunt-faced man with bushy hair, thin lips, a broad nose, and an intense stare.</p>\n<p>\"Oloman Kosowana, one of the church's former primary cogs'the second-highest rank one can attain within the Brighite priesthood. A real wiz with clockworks, apparently, plus anything else he sets his mind to. Curious to a fault, you might say. He was booted from the church a while ago for breaking protocol and promoting heretical conspiracy theories. Last time anyone saw him in public was at our friend Vashon Gattlebee's pyronite demonstration.\" Dunsmith raises her eyebrows meaningfully.</p>\n<p>\"Kosowana kept a low profile 'til recently, doing his own thing at his workshop in Ferrous Quarter. We got a few complaints from neighbors of loud booms coming from the workshop, but nothing serious.

Dunsmith put in a word at the Temple and arranged for the characters to meet with <strong>Tertiary Cog Mintakus</strong> (LN female human priest of Brigh 5), a formal priestess who often deals with the church's public affairs. Mintakus is accompanied by an acolyte named <strong>Duga</strong> (LN male human acolyte of Brigh 2), who carries a large, leatherbound book fastened with bronze gears. This book is a copy of Logic of Design, Brigh's primary scripture and manual of regulations.</p>\n<p>As a faithful representative of the Temple of Brigh, Mintakus is happy to answer any questions her guests might have. She speaks with a formal, mechanical cadence, responding to most inquiries with but a few words before motioning for her acolyte to recite a particularly poignant paragraph from Logic of Design by way of explanation.</p>\n<p>Following are some of the characters' most likely questions for Mintakus, along with an example of Mintakus's answer for each.</p>\n<aside class=\"sidebar float-left\">\n\t<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Brigh's Faith</h1>\n\t<p>Brigh, also known as the Bronze Lady or the Whisper in Bronze, is the goddess of clockwork and invention. Her areas of concern also include time, primarily its measurement through the use of clocks. The subject of time travel, though tangentially related to Brigh's domain, is unorthodox in most Brighite circles.</p>\n\t<p>Brigh's holy text is called Logic of Design. By way of parables and guidance called regulations, the text exhorts inventors to experiment rigorously and to preserve knowledge of their work for future generations. Unlike many holy books, Logic of Design is regularly updated as new discoveries are made, with old versions recalled and replaced with revised texts. Regulations are rigorously numbered and organized into sections, subsections, paragraphs, and subparagraphs as needed. When updated, text is never renumbered, making it possible for astute readers to trace the evolution of Brighite thought by studying omissions and addenda.</p>\n\t<p>In Alkenstar, clergy members of the Temple of Brigh are organized into a rigid hierarchy. At the bottom of the pecking order are acolytes, who are overseen by priests known as cogs. These cogs range in seniority from tertiary cogs (the lowest-ranking individuals) to grand cogs (the highest rank achievable in the church). Grand cogs wield great authority within the church and sometimes take on colorful monikers, such as High Clockmother Athenth Llanalir. </p>\n</aside>\n<p><strong>Do you know where Oloman Kosowana is?</strong> Mintakus raises an eyebrow in mild surprise. \"We haven't kept up with the goings-on of the former primary cog for quite some time. In accord with Regulation Fourteen-Five-Two, Oloman Kosowana is no longer associated with our temple.\" She turns to the acolyte, who opens the complex clockwork latching mechanism on his book, quickly locates the appropriate passage, and hands the book to the party, pointing to a heading that reads \"Regulation 14.5.2\" so they can read along while the acolyte recites the text from memory.</p>\n<p>\"Regulation fourteen-five-two. All components shall advance the functional or aesthetic qualities of the device. Any component which does not serve the whole shall be excised.\" The acolyte closes the book as he finishes the last phrase.</p>\n<p>Mintakus nods, eyes closed, savoring the logic of the words. \"So it was with Primary Cog Kosowana. He chose not to serve the church, so was declared superfluous to our needs. He continues to serve the Whisper in Bronze in his own way, perhaps, but not in an official capacity. I believe his workshop is in the Ferrous Quarter along the river, three blocks west of Hammer Street.\"</p>\n<p>Further discussion with Mintakus can reveal more information about Kosowana. Some likely questions the characters might ask and Mintakus's answers are provided below.</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you say Kosowana \"did not serve the whole\" of the church?</strong> Mintakus frowns and pauses to consider the question. \"Regulation Four-Seven-Five guides us,\" she says. She gestures to the acolyte, who recites the passage from memory:</p>\n<p>\"It is not for the Gear to determine how it will turn, but for the Maker to set the Design. Each Gear must work with those beside it, or else the Device will fail.\"</p>\n<p>Mintakus nods. \"Oloman found himself fascinated with some of the... less accurate records in our archives, from which he formed a peculiar worldview. Instead of helping to grow the knowledge of the faith, he fell victim to lies and half-truths. Grand Cog Llanalir finally had to ask him to retire from public duties to prevent further embarrassment.\"</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_LOGIC_OF_DESIGN.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_LOGIC_OF_DESIGN.webp');\">\n<p><strong>What are these records?</strong> The acolyte recites another passage in response. \"Regulation Three-One-Seven. In order to truly create an original Device, one must first create the entire cosmos. All Makers build upon those who have come before, and it is the duty of every Maker to leave a foundation for future Makers to build upon.\" Mintakus nods again in agreement, then elaborates.</p>\n<p>\"Even old texts rife with error are retained by our order, but some stories from the past are meant as allegory, or require heavy revision or annotation in light of new understandings. Oloman took a few such stories literally, and it infected his work, his teaching, even his mind. You must understand, every religion has those who believe they have cracked the code or uncovered truths that generations of researchers before them have missed. When presented with evidence, these people merely invent a bigger conspiracy to explain away the incongruity that allows them to maintain their beliefs.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know where he might have gone?</strong> \"I do not. Oloman and I have not spoken since he left the church years ago. All I can do is direct you to his workshop; perhaps his neighbors may be able to provide you with the information you seek.\"</p>\n<p>Once they've finished their conversation, Mintakus gives the party Oloman Kosowana's last known address, along with meticulously detailed directions to get there from the Temple of Brigh.</p>\n<p><strong>Further Aid</strong>:If the characters improve Mintakus's attitude to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.v66R7FdOf11l94im]{Friendly}, she gives them a copy of the most recent version of Logic of Design, the Brighite holy book, and encourages them to incorporate its teachings into their life.</p>\n<p><strong>The Sacred Library</strong>:If Mintakus's attitude is improved to @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.v44P3WUcU1j0115l]{Helpful}, she hesitantly suggests the party might glean some knowledge in the Asynchronous Archives, the library of sacred materials in the temple's basement. \"Kosowana, though a powerful primary cog, was not exempt from the many rules he broke while accessing the archives,\" Mintakus says. 'Perhaps you might learn something of the man by reading some of the same books he did.'</p>\n<p>In accord with the tortuous logic that defines much of the Temple of Brigh's tenets, the Asynchronous Archives are more accessible to those outside the church than those within it; whereas cogs and acolytes are forbidden from entering the library without submitting multiple request forms specifying exactly what they wish to study, guests are permitted to peruse the church's library freely once per month for a single visit up to 24 hours. Of course, visitors are still required to sign a strict nondisclosure agreement forbidding them from revealing any information they learn to others. The penalty for breaking this agreement is submission to a geas ritual to prevent further disclosure, plus a lifelong ban from all of the Temple of Brigh's libraries.

The 13th Ordinal had a specific interest in the Cradle of Quartz, a former Brighite holy site in the Spellscar, which they believed was key to uncovering the truth of Brigh and the ultimate understanding of time.

Like the party, they are looking for Kosowana and believe they can find clues in the Asynchronous Archives.

Though made of brass and steel, the construct remains sentient even when its clockwork body winds down, leaving it in a frightening liminal state between consciousness and sleep, more like paralysis than unconsciousness. Kosowana never considered the moral implications of binding a sentient soul to a clockwork creation when he envisioned a new line of sentient clockworks able to learn from their mistakes and devise solutions to unforeseen problems.

The player characters need to reach the Cradle of Quartz, a remote Brighite shrine where Oloman Kosowana is lying low. Once they find their pilot - a has-been navigator named Phera Wyndslow'the characters must defend the airship from Mana Wastes marauders and misfits. A freak mana storm brings their journey to a crashing halt, and they trek the remaining distance to the Cradle of Quartz on foot. In the process, they encounter some of the wild and weird denizens of the Spellscar.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>In 4612 AR, a wandering priest of @Compendium[pf2e.deities.vEMCpm7iidycRT5D]{Brigh} named Harcourt the Fisher traveled the few safe trade routes near the Gebbite edge of the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17905thespe.JournalEntryPage.05spellscardes00]{Spellscar Desert}. Fleeing a band of gnolls, Harcourt ran deeper into the desert, hoping to lose his pursuers in the maze of canyons. He found a cave system, where he stumbled upon an amazing site: a series of caverns full of gigantic quartz crystals, each of a size and purity the likes of which he'd never seen. </p>\n<p>Harcourt spent several weeks exploring the caves. When he emerged, almost no time had passed in the outside world: the gnolls were still there, and they captured him. During months of harrowing captivity, Harcourt penned a series of articles detailing his discoveries in the mysterious caves. When he finally escaped, he published his book through the Temple of Brigh. Though full of confusing details, contradictions, and muddled facts, Harcourt's text was a compelling enough read that the primary cogs of Brigh incorporated aspects of it into their canon.</p>\n<p>Over the next decade, the clergy of Brigh visited the remote caverns Harcourt described. No one could duplicate the temporal effects Harcourt insists he experienced, but cogs were thrilled to find that the caves were indeed packed with flawlessly pure quartz crystals. The Temple of Brigh in Alkenstar christened the site \"the Cradle of Quartz.\" Despite the danger of travel through the Spellscar, a few devoted Brighites still undertook the perilous journey to the site to commune with their deity in the central cave, which was surrounded by immense crystals. Over time, these pilgrims transformed the raw site into a small shrine to their patron goddess.</p>\n<p>In 4688 ar, the Cradle of Quartz was quickly and quietly excised from Brighite tradition. All references to the place were removed from the oral traditions and public written records of the church. Only the oldest cogs know the reason for the sudden expulsion: sometime before 4688 AR, something came to the Cradle of Quartz and violently murdered every worshipper and pilgrim present. The pilgrim who discovered the massacre brought word to the Temple of Brigh, but the clerics took the message to heart only after the pilgrim's mutilated body was found in the streets of Alkenstar the next morning. Follow-up investigations and divinations revealed that something within the enormous crystals of the Cradle of Quartz emerged from another dimension and tore every living being to pieces. Although the beast left its victims in tatters, it seemingly did so without shedding a single drop of blood. The church refers to this creature only as \"the claws from beyond\" in the few documents that record the events.</p>\n<p>When Primary Cog Oloman Kosowana delved into the Temple of Brigh's Asynchronous Archives, he discovered, among other things, the existence and location of the Cradle of Quartz. The 13th Ordinal, a heretical skelm masquerading as prophet, wrote that the Cradle of Quartz could be used not only to dilate time but to reverse it completely. True believers, according to \"13,\" could undo errors of the past. After he managed to reverse engineer pyronite in a matter of weeks, Kosowana knew this weapon couldn't be allowed to exist. He fled, carried by his clockwork sphinx, to the Cradle of Quartz in the hopes of turning back time and stopping Vashon Gattlebee from inventing pyronite in the first place. To find the exiled cleric and ensure his safety (and, more importantly, the safety of his knowledge), the party must follow Kosowana's example, traveling by air across the dangerous Mana Wastes into the deepest reaches of the Spellscar.</p>\n"},"Flight Plan":{"name":"Flight Plan","text":"\n<p>This chapter begins soon after the player characters discover that Oloman Kosowana fled to the Cradle of Quartz in the Spellscar Desert.

Tertiary Cog Mintakus can also make this suggestion, noting the Cradle of Quartz is a long way away from Alkenstar.</p>\n<p>If the characters express concern that the Gilded Gunners might have stolen Kosowana's formula, Dunsmith assures them other agents of the duchess are already on the case. \"Shiny as gold, they're still a slippery bunch,\" she says of the gang. \"While you're retrieving Kosowana, I'll figure out where our gilded friends are.

The simplest design is a balloon: a lighter-than-air vehicle that floats freely on the prevailing winds. A balloon usually has a single envelope to hold lighter-than-air gas, with an open basket or gondola hanging below.</p>\n\t<p>A dirigible is any lighter-than-air vehicle that's both powered and steerable. A blimp is a type of dirigible that's like a powered, steerable balloon: a single bag of lighter-than-air gas with a gondola below, powered by engines and with steering vanes to allow control of direction and altitude. A rigid airship is a dirigible that has a light framework to maintain the shape of the envelope, filled with multiple cells of lighter-than-air gas. This is the type of flying vehicle most commonly operated in Alkenstar and is what most people mean when they use the term \"airship.\"</p>\n\t<p>Most Alkenstar airships fill their envelopes with floranine, a naturally occurring, lighter-than-air gas harvested from a series of geyser-like vents north of the city. Floranine is nontoxic and nonflammable, and remains gaseous at a wide range of temperatures, making it perfect for use in airships.</p>\n</aside>\n"},"Finding a Pilot":{"name":"Finding a Pilot","text":"\n<p>Traveling to the Cradle of Quartz by land is a quick way to meet a grisly end.

Besides, a land journey from Alkenstar to the Cradle of Quartz would take 3 weeks at minimum, and Dunsmith urges the characters to make haste.

Airships like the Second Kiss can make the trip from Alkenstar to the Gunworks or to Cloudreaver Keep in a day's travel in relative comfort. Airships require specialized facilities to load and unload cargo, limiting their regular use to travel between well-equipped ports. If needed, the Second Kiss can \"land\" by descending nearly to ground level and using several anchors and cables to tie the dirigible down, though doing so requires a large open, flat area.

These areas correspond to the map on page 26.

The frames are connected by a truss walkway on the top and both sides, and by the main cabin on the bottom. Inside the envelope are additional frames dividing the space into 12 segments that each contain an airtight bladder full of floranine gas. A narrow walkway runs the length of the dirigible along either side of the outer envelope, and ladders are built into each frame, allowing maintenance of the floranine gas bags even while in flight. Additional catwalks run along the sides to exterior walkways that lead to the engine nacelles.</p>\n<p><strong>Upper Observation Deck:</strong> The top of the Second Kiss has a flat platform where passengers brave enough to make the climb can witness spectacular panoramic views. The platform is accessible either by the ladders inside the main envelope or along a set of rungs built into the exterior skin of the dirigible's gas envelope (the rungs are off limits while the vessel is in flight). In desperate times, Wyndslow posts one of her crew to the platform to keep watch'a very unpopular duty.

The Brighites used the hollow geode as a meditation chamber for those seeking Brigh's wisdom.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the Brighites carved a sizeable shrine into the cliff surrounding the geode, which they named the Cradle of Quartz.

The Temple of Brigh's grand cog branded Droxolos's theory the \"Concurrent Heresy\" and suppressed all information regarding the Cradle of Quartz, restricting site access to only the highest-ranking clergy - an action which only reaffirmed the conspiracy's veracity in the eyes of its adherents. Droxolos and his followers fled to the Cradle of Quartz and cut themselves off from the outside world and from Brigh.

The bedrock beneath the sands is wracked with raw, wildly unpredictable magic that still leaks into Golarion through the tears in reality inflicted by the archmages Nex and Geb. The furious battles they fought more than 4,000 years ago turned the region between their mighty nations into an inhospitable waste.</p>\n<p>In the Spellscar Desert, many creatures contract a gradual illness that, over time, makes hair and fur fall out in clumps; imparts dry coughs or other internal ailments; and causes mutations, stillbirths, or worse. Some magical creatures simply sicken and die of indiscernible causes. Fortunately, these conditions usually clear up with time once outside the hazardous desert. After generations, however, creatures that remain within the Spellscar have become all but unrecognizable: they might grow to phenomenal size or gain bizarre coloration, sprout bony protrusions or tumorous masses, or grow additional limbs and sensory organs. Many of the humanoid mutants of the Spellscar Desert - formerly humans, dwarves, gnolls, and others pushed to the outskirts of civilization - are now all but unrecognizable.</p>\n<p>The following pages include ideas and inspiration for GMs running adventures in the Spellscar Desert. Much of the general advice can be adapted or extrapolated to apply to other regions of the Mana Wastes as well. For even more rules and details for Mana Wastes adventures, see the Mana Wastes section in Pathfinder Lost Omens: Impossible Lands.</p>\n"},"Adventuring in the Spellscar Desert":{"name":"Adventuring in the Spellscar Desert","text":"\n<p>A band of hardy travelers might brave the Spellscar Desert for any number of reasons. Academics might seek information about the long-ago clash between Nex and Geb, while other historians might include knowledgeable treasure hunters seeking relics from that age of impossible wonders. Brave scholars might seek to understand the storms of twisted magic that wrack the land, either to better predict them or to harness their power for their own ends. The people who inhabit the Spellscar Desert sometimes harbor secrets of interest to the wider world: an escaped criminal hiding in the desert might be the sole keeper of valuable information, or a mutant gang might know where to find strange ruins or unique firearms. Plucky merchants might enter the desert only to cross it quickly, shuttling high-value items between Nex and Geb. Regardless of the reason that travelers brave the desert, it's wise for all of them to keep the following points in mind.</p>\n    <p><strong>Prepare for Bad Weather:</strong> Outsiders assume there's only one kind of weather in the Spellscar Desert: dry and hot. This oversimplification ignores three dangerous environmental conditions of the area. First, temperatures plummet after dark as the land quickly surrenders the heat it soaked up during the day; nights can be cold enough for frost to form, depending on the season. Second, storms regularly scour the Spellscar Desert. Swaths of land entirely devoid of life likely have the worst weather and should be avoided. Finally, water in the desert comes fast and hard. Springs might pulse with primal magic, erupting in geysers; while riverbeds swell with each rare rain, sluicing water through the thirsty landscape. In narrow canyons and dusty gulches, flash floods are both common and deadly.</p>\n    <p><strong>Stay Hidden and Move Quickly:</strong> Predators in the Spellscar Desert come in many varieties, and all have honed their talents and natural gifts to survive the harsh climate. Monstrously mutated animals and beasts are common, but bandits and other two-legged predators are just as canny and dangerous. It's important to wear concealing clothing and to seek cover when traveling or camping to avoid becoming a target. Even travelers convinced of their combat prowess should remember that there's often something bigger or tougher prowling the desert and apply caution. Worse, some magic-twisted predators might have strange senses (such as the ability to scent despair or see souls), so a traveler can't ever fully assume they'll be able to wander entirely undetected. Those crossing the Spellscar should stay on the move when possible.</p>\n    <p><strong>Looks Can Deceive:</strong> For a place of openly brutal terrain, the Spellscar Desert abounds with hidden perils. The most significant of these are @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17905thespe.JournalEntryPage.05manastorms0000]{Mana Storms}. Although genuine storms are dangerous, it's usually possible to see them coming. The effects of a mana storm, however, are random, occurring with no warning. One moment magic works normally, and the next, everything changes. Rains of squealing leeches can patter down from a cloudless sky, or gravity might suddenly shift - but only for random creatures. Beyond the menace of mana storms, creatures and people also might not be all they seem, leading travelers to misjudge threats. A rail-thin figure in a tattered cloak might be a deadly assassin robot, or a hulking mutant might be an afflicted scholar with intellectual sensibilities. Even the terrain can lie: clean water might rest beneath a cruft of dust, and mirages are all too common. A wise traveler never makes decisions based on appearances alone.</p>\n    <p><strong>Avoid Abandoned Technology:</strong> The magic that flows wildly through the Spellscar means that some travelers, especially those from nearby Alkenstar, rely on technological marvels to survive. They might use a steam-powered wagon to cross the barren terrain, a mechanical condenser to pull water from the air, or a large-bore firearm to keep predators at bay. When technology breaks down in the desert, there's usually little to do except abandon it to the elements. The desert is therefore littered with broken technological inventions, some of them unique contraptions that failed at the worst possible time. Wasteland gangs sometimes recover these devices (particularly weapons) and try to repair them, but such tinkering can leave items even more dangerous than before. In any case, it's best to approach any abandoned technology in the Spellscar Desert with caution; it's likely failed someone else in the past and could do so again. </p>\n"},"Factions and NPCs":{"name":"Factions and NPCs","text":"\n<p>The Spellscar Desert is home to many rival mutant gangs, hardscrabble survivalists, and worse. The factions below are among the region's most significant groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Boneseekers:</strong> The region known as the Dinosaur Uplands is usually avoided by travelers due to its lack of potable water and large population of monstrous reptilian creatures (including, but not limited to, dinosaurs). However, the recent discovery of strange fossilized bones in the area has sparked interest from universities and academies all across the Inner Sea region. Each group of these so-called Boneseekers has staked out claims where they diligently work to excavate the fossils and their secrets from the ground. The most scrupulous of these scholars, such as those from the Magaambya led by Aluopunu Salsket (NG female human paleontologist 8), must defend themselves against sabotage and theft by unprincipled Boneseekers. Chief among these is Alastair Harbrum (LE male human historian 9), a scholar from Ustalav whose claim has proven nearly devoid of interesting finds but whose reputation hinges on a significant discovery. All Boneseekers must contend not only with the rough environment and dangerous fauna, but also with the revitalized haunts of long-dormant creatures disturbed by their excavations.</p>\n<p><strong>Children of the Fireball:</strong> This pack of overzealous firebugs and arsonists is among the most desperate and violent of the Spellscar gangs. The so-called Children of the Fireball live in caves and huts in the shelter of Fireball Mesa, where they purport to worship the erratic fiery displays that coruscate atop the rocky tableland. They tend to raid other wasteland dwellers and assault desert travelers using @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.gWr4q4HiyGhETA8H]{Alchemist's Fire} and other incendiary devices of their own creation, insisting that their violent acts of banditry are in fact displays of religious reverence. Only the group's leader, Falthin Born-From-Fire (CE male fleshwarp fire priest 10), whose great-grandfather founded the gang, actually believes this theological rhetoric, but his zeal is fervent enough to fuel the entire enterprise. He claims to glean guidance by unlocking messages from the strange shapes burned into the side of the mesa long ago.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_KAGATI_WIZARD-EATER.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_KAGATI_WIZARD-EATER.webp');\">\n<p><strong>Kagati's Clan:</strong> Most followers of the mutated gnoll warlord Kagati Wizard-Eater (NE female gnoll warlord 9) are her blood relatives.

Yet her \"clan,\" as they call themselves, also consists of other humanoid mutants who serve the warlord in exchange for spoils and protection. Operating out of a fortified estate created years ago by a short-sighted wizard, Kagati's clan seeks to dominate the Spellscar Desert not with open warfare, but with alliances of convenience and calculated strikes against enemy leaders. Kagati knows that to share spoils is to earn allies, and she often sets up \"market days\" where anyone can come to trade, carouse, or swear allegiance. </p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_GRAGKED.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_GRAGKED.webp');\">\n<p><strong>Gragked's Stormchasers:</strong> Scholars journey to the Spellscar Desert to study the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17905thespe.JournalEntryPage.05manastorms0000]{Mana Storms} surprisingly often, and a few of them even survive the trip. The most knowledgeable scholar currently in the desert is Gragked (NE male ghoul professor 10), a popular teacher from Geb's highly regarded Mortuarium. Gragked has been steeped in the cutthroat intrigue of Geb's academic scene for centuries, and he's found this excursion to be not only enlightening but liberating. Although he and his team of undead graduate students have made copious notes about mana storms and the effects they can produce, he's considering taking his research to Absalom rather than back to Geb. As two of Gragked's students are covertly affiliated with Geb's secret police, the well-intentioned academic is in more jeopardy than he realizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Voidenders:</strong> Millennia ago, tribes of six-armed giants called @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.EvLBhZSMrzVDk4mM]{Calikang} fled enslavement in Nex and resettled upon the coast to the east of the Spellscar Desert. Calikang locals see the Mana Wastes not as a tear in reality through which uncontrolled magic can pour, but as the result of the absence of natural magic. They've committed themselves to refilling this void left by the archmages' battles and healing the Spellscar Desert for good. To do so, they venture out of their coastal homes to acquire magical items from other lands, bring them back, and release their energies into the Spellscar Desert. The largest of these calikang tribes is the Voidenders, led by Sool (N agender calikang prophet 13), but many use that name to refer to any of the calikang groups that pursue these same ends. Some consider the Voidenders to be environmental activists - as their holdings of Sixfists are indeed fertile - while others consider them bullies who merely steal and destroy magic items.</p>\n"},"Mana Storms":{"name":"Mana Storms","text":"\n<p>Storms of misdirected magic scour the Spellscar Desert, bringing strange magical effects to sudden life. These mana storms are short-lived but have wracked the land ever since Nex and Geb tore at the fabric of reality with their dueling magic millennia ago. Mana storms sometimes accompany mundane dust storms or dry lightning, adding menace to the bad weather. A bolt of electricity crackling from the sky might bear a malign, temporary intelligence, zig-zagging among travelers with murderous glee. The dry winds might drop flowers or frogs, bringing the desert to unexpected and ersatz life in a profusion of primal magic. Yet mana storms are often invisible as well, with nothing to herald their arrival other than a strange rippling in the air easily mistaken for heat shimmer. The magical power in these mana storms is often as immense as the storms are uncontrollable. Although a lucky traveler might find a trusted magic item suddenly working even better than before, the arrival of a mana storm is just as likely to overload and detonate the item with a sudden influx of magical energy.</p>\n<p>Mana storms have a spell level just like any spell effect. You can roll 1d10 for this level (on a roll of 10, reroll, keeping a level of 10 only if you roll a second 10), but it's rarely fun or fair to inflict a mana storm on your players that has a much higher level than the highest-level spells their characters can cast. Several elements of a mana storm are determined by its level. If the storm's effect duplicates a spell, that spell's effects resolve as if heightened to the storm's level (if you roll an effect for a spell with a minimum level above the mana storm's level, choose a different result or roll again). The mana storm's level also sets the relevant DC for a saving throw or skill check required by the mana storm. Use the hard DC that corresponds with the storm's spell level on the DCs by Level table on page 503 of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook. </p>\n<p>Mana storms have unpredictable effects. You can choose an effect from the table on page 70 or roll d20 to select one at random. In this table, \"level\" or \"storm's level\" means the spell level of the mana storm. The mana storm's traits appear in parentheses after the effect's name. Immediately following this is the type of saving throw a character can attempt against the storm's DC to resist being affected by the storm (an entry that creates monsters or other hazards to challenge the party resolves in encounter mode, and so doesn't list a saving throw type). You might consider replacing any entry you use with a new one of your own design, so the players never see the same result twice.</p>\n<p>@RollTable[MEMyVpNP9lImb9je]{Mana Storm Effects}</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc table\">Table: Mana Storm Effects</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>d20</th><th>Mana Storm Effect</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1</td><td>Bleaching (primal, transmutation) Fortitude. Creatures and objects within a radius of 10 feet per level are drained of color for 1 hour. A gnome affected by this effect must succeed at a Will save or become frightened 1 and unable to reduce this frightened condition below 1 while bleached of color; this is a mental and fear effect. </td></tr>\n<tr><td>2</td><td>Crawling Vermin (conjuration, primal) A monstrous, strangely colored insect hostile to all creatures appears within 60 feet. The creature that appears should be insectile in appearance and of a level approximately equal to the level of an animal summoned by summon animal of the storm's level. The GM determines the specific creature. After 1 minute, the creature can choose to either return where it came from or to remain. It's neither summoned nor a minion.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>3</td><td>Anchored (abjuration, arcane) Will. Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by dimensional anchor.

Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per level, in random order, are pushed 10 feet per level away from the nearest creature. A pushed creature that hits an object or another creature stops but takes falling damage equal to the distance moved (a creature hit takes the same amount of falling damage).</td></tr>\n<tr><td>7</td><td>Psychic Assault (illusion, mental, nonlethal, occult) Will. Creatures within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by phantom pain.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>8</td><td>Dazzling Mein (illusion, occult, visual) One creature is affected by cloak of colors; that creature is immune to the effects, but all others around it are affected normally.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>9</td><td>Geyser (evocation, primal, water) Fortitude. Water erupts from the ground, but rather than spraying directly up into the air, the water bends impossibly to surge along a horizontal path just above the ground, like a floating, torrential flood. This torrent of water manifests as a hydraulic torrent at first, eerily doing so in the most efficient line to catch as many potential targets in its path as it can. The water then splashes down into the sand, remaining as a long, thin swath of water that can provide a drinking source until it's soaked up or evaporates.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10</td><td>Sudden Pit (conjuration, earth, primal) Reflex. A pit opens beneath a random creature. The pit is as wide as the creature's space, so the creature can Grab an Edge to avoid a fall. The pit is 20 feet deep per level of the mana storm and remains open even in terrain normally unable to support such a structure. After 1 hour, the pit vanishes and anything that fell in is restored to the surface.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>11</td><td>Befuddlement (arcane, emotion, enchantment, mental) Will. A number of creatures up to the level of the mana storm within a radius of 10 feet per level become confused for 1 round per level. </td></tr>\n<tr><td>12</td><td>Death Field (necromancy, primal) Fortitude. Normal vegetation within a radius of 10 feet per level immediately dies and turns to ash. Plant creatures take 2d6 damage per level of the mana storm (basic Fortitude save).</td></tr>\n<tr><td>13</td><td>Strangers to All (arcane, curse, enchantment, mental, misfortune) Will. A number of creatures up to the level of the mana storm within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by outcast's curse.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>14-15</td><td>Weird Rain (conjuration, primal) A rain of small objects (anything from flowers to rotten fruit) pelts an area with a radius of 10 feet per level of the mana storm for a number of rounds equal to the level. This rain doesn't harm creatures in the area. Creatures in the area have concealment. The objects remain even after the rain is over.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>16-17</td><td>Wellspring (primal, varies) The mana storm draws magical potential from deep within a random creature. That creature rolls 1d20 and uses the Wellspring Surges table (Pathfinder Secrets of Magic 250) to determine a wellspring effect.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>18-19</td><td>Wondrous Effect (arcane, evocation) Randomly choose one creature to be a \"wielder\" and a different random creature to be a \"target.\" Roll d% on the rod of wonder table (Core Rulebook 575) to determine what sort of strange effect occurs between the creatures.</td></tr>\n<tr><td>20</td><td>Double Strength (varies) Reroll two results and apply both in the order rolled; further results of 20 on these rerolls have no effect.</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n"},"Gazetteer":{"name":"Gazetteer","text":"\n<p>The Spellscar Desert may be desolate, but it's far from monotonous; its rolling wastes house numerous geographical anomalies, unusual communities both violent and benign, and safe landmarks (by Mana Wastes standards, at least).

Predicting a moment of intense earth magic, Ancren raised the stone of the fortified estate in a single night. After the magic departed, the estate remained, and Ancren soon outfitted it with sumptuous luxuries from his homeland. Although the estate's walls were wide and tall, Ancren dramatically underestimated how appealing such a fortification would be to Spellscar inhabitants.

The silt is never more than a few inches deep and appears to prevent anything other than a few low-lying succulents from growing. A number of small, amber-colored lizards flit among the silt, occasionally snapping at tiny insects or drinking from pools of yellow-tinged water. Sapient creatures who spend a long time in the silty region report hearing strange susurrations and seeing strange movement within the yellow silt, as though the substance itself were alive.

The side against the river is steep, requiring successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:25|traits:action:climb|name:Climb] checks to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb}; the DC is only @Check[type:athletics|dc:18|traits:action:climb|name:Climb] on the mesa's other sides. The top of the mesa has a stunning view and is covered with thorny berry bushes and ruins reduced to scattered stones. A group of @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.AuCC04X2AO8oFN75]{Harpies} and their trained falcons control the mesa and scour a huge area around it to feed themselves and grow their flock. These harpies are insular and suspicious, as commanded by their elder, Mother Dunfeather (LN female harpy leader 6) but they're less bloodthirsty than most harpies and are willing to negotiate with explorers who bring them food and colorful cloth with which to decorate their wings.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloudreaver Keep:</strong> Built to guard Alkenstar's northern border, Cloudreaver Keep stands on the Ustradi River and is considered by many to be the easternmost outpost of civilization in Alkenstar. This makes Cloudreaver Keep the westernmost point of the Spellscar Desert. Its soldiers don't venture far into the desert, preferring instead to act as sentries who repel monsters from populated lands. Despite the soldiers' disinclination to leave Cloudreaver Keep, the fortified structure is the best place from which to launch most expeditions into the desert.</p>\n<p><strong>Desperation Arroyo:</strong> This broad cleft in the ground runs north to south near Burning Stone Mesa. Its sides are dangerously unstable, accounting in most places as a @Compendium[pf2e.hazards.gFt2nzQrVgXM9tmJ]{Treacherous Scree} hazard. Parts of the arroyo's bottom are exposed patches of the same blue stone as Burning Stone Mesa. Scoured by the winds that blow through the arroyo and covered with pebbles from past landslides, these streaks of blue stone often resemble pools of water. Several travelers have ventured into the arroyo, eager for a drink, and found themselves trapped within by the unstable walls. The bones of these travelers (as well as the treasures they were carrying when they died) lie scattered in the arroyo near the deceptively enticing stone.</p>\n<p><strong>Dinosaur Uplands:</strong> This region features sharp hills made of thick sections of layered sedimentary rock pushed up in haphazard angles through tectonic instability millennia ago. The rock faces are thus a striation of colorful layers dotted with fossilized leaves and petrified bones. Many of these bones belong to creatures that perished during Earthfall or even earlier; dinosaur bones mostly, but also bones of massive reptilian humanoids who died alongside the dinosaurs as well. Word of these bones have recently reached the academic centers of the Inner Sea region, causing an influx of scholars and excavators eager to pull bones - and knowledge - from the rocks. These scholars, collectively called Boneseekers, vie with each other as they race to make significant discoveries.</p>\n<p><strong>Fireball Mesa:</strong> This large, pale mesa gets its name from the pattern of scorch marks along its sides. The area attracts mana storms on a frequent yet unpredictable basis, and its storms most often manifest with blasts of fire that make for dramatic displays visible from far away. A few canny wasteland dwellers, including the Children of the Fireball, live in the lee of the mesa, as they've learned that the mana storms aggregate at the mesa's top, making the region at its foot relatively tame. </p>\n<p><strong>Gritty River:</strong> This river is the primary source of water for the Spellscar Desert, flowing east into the Obari Ocean. Once occupying a wide riverbed, the river is now unreliable. In the late summer through the fall, long stretches of the river dry up, leaving large sections of marshy sand between worn boulders. These sections function as @Compendium[pf2e.hazards.C6nFe8SCWJ8FmLOT]{Quicksand}. Where water remains, it becomes stagnant until the river flows again. Creatures and wasteland gangs jealously guard this water. Even in late winter and early spring, the river is generally low and difficult to traverse except in a canoe or on a barge. The water's color, for the sections and seasons that see a steady flow, is a curious turquoise due to strange minerals leached from the worn boulders along the river's length. Rumors hold that these boulders are leftover ammunition from a skirmish along the long border between Nex and Geb - though it's unclear which side launched the boulders or what the minerals imbuing the stony ammunition were intended to do. </p>\n<p><strong>Screaming Fields:</strong> The only sandy waste within the Spellscar Desert, this area is dotted with stands of sagebrush and little else. Burrowing insects of startling size prowl the hills, fighting with each other in titanic battles that shake the sands and reshape the dunes. When these colossal creatures clash above the surface, which is thankfully rare, their screeches echo across the landscape and instill strange psychic rages in creatures that hear them.</p>\n<p><strong>Sixfists:</strong> This coastal area in the northeast corner of the Spellscar Desert is the domain of calikang tribes. Although the tribes aren't enemies with each other, they have restrictive social structures that prevent them from outright cooperation with one another. Sixfists is what outsiders call this area, as the calikang tribes refer to their own tribal territories individually.</p>\n<p><strong>Stargazer's Tower:</strong> At the southern edge of the Baffled Lowlands rises a single, massive sandstone column. Roughly rectangular, the tower rises 200 feet above the silty floor. Narrow, shallow stairs rise in a steady run around the column's exterior, their chipped and rounded edges demonstrating their ancient age. Near the top is a small cave containing etchings of various constellations. A successful @Check[type:nature|dc:25] or applicable Lore check reveals that these star charts are predominantly of the Cosmic Caravan, the zodiac in Golarion's sky, but they also incorporate specific celestial events. These events aren't concurrent; for example, the meteors of Earthfall are depicted, but so are much more recent meteorological impacts. Other, unknown symbols might represent cosmological events yet to occur. Characters performing divination rituals within this cave gain a +1 circumstance bonus to their ritual skill checks or a +2 bonus if the divination ritual is connected to prophetic events heralded in the stars. </p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_EROSIONS_EXHALATION.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_EROSIONS_EXHALATION.webp');\">\n<p><strong>Stonewatcher Ridges:</strong> The southeast section of the Spellscar contains some of the most difficult yet spectacular features in the desert. Four nearly parallel ridges of sandstone pillars run through the area, separated by strips of uneven ground awash in sand and gravel. Bands of red, orange, and tan cover the naturally carved pillars. Most are connected, the thinner sandstone forming walls between the thicker pillars. Scrambling over these slippery ridges requires a successful @Check[type:athletics|dc:30|traits:action:climb|name:Climb] to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb}. Most creatures traverse the channels between, though this can make them easy pickings for those who hunt at either end of the ridges. A large group of earth elementals revere the sandstone ridges with religious fervor. Anyone disturbing the ridges - including climbing over them without taking exceptional care to avoid scarring or chipping them - risks an attack by a small army of earth elementals, but those traveling between the ridges are generally safe.

You can use the rules for creating a Mana Wastes mutant to create any sort of mutated creature, such as might occur after exposure to otherworldly radiation in Numeria, succumbing to planar effects from a chaotic outer plane, imbibing a potent mutagen like the notorious milk of Lamashtu, or suffering potent side effects from a ritual gone catastrophically wrong.</p>\n</section>\n<p><strong>Afflicting Strike</strong>: The mutant must have a jaws, claw, sting, or other melee Strike to gain this ability. That Strike now inflicts a disease, poison, or similar affliction on a hit, with a Fortitude save to resist. You can use the rules for existing monsters of the mutant’s level for diseases, poisons, and similar afflictions to give to your mutant, or you can simply say the strike inflicts an additional 1d6 poison damage + an additional 1d6 points per 4 mutant levels on a hit, with a basic Fortitude save. This makes the Strike significantly more deadly, so reduce the damage in other ways to account for this increase</p>\n<p><strong>Energy Resistance</strong>: The mutant has strangely colored skin or fur and gains resistance to a single type of energy damage.

Choose whether the mutant creates a 60-foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when it activates this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a basic Reflex save. The mutant can’t use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Inoculation</strong>: The mutant’s flesh is distorted with the addition of unexpected fur, scales, warts, or other growths. The creature gains a +2 status bonus to saves against disease and poison.

Such is the grim tale of the first trapjaw tangles. These mechanical swarms were initially created as a solution to the pestilence of mutated rodents that plagued Alkenstar. These mobile rat traps, bound together by a magical matrix of occult energy, were programmed to wait in ambush or chase down their prey. The first trapjaw tangles proved effective and their creators were well rewarded for their ingenious designs. Soon trapjaw tangles were deployed throughout Alkenstar, Martel, and the Gunworks. Waves of them would be sent to roam into the Spellscar Desert, and the ever-present vermin were quickly forgotten.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179-trap-jaw_swarm.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179-trap-jaw_swarm.webp');\">\n<p>Then disaster struck. A rogue wave of magical energy washed over an airship that carried a trapjaw tangle in its hold. The magical affliction scrambled the tangle's programming and gave the swarm just enough intellect to send it on a red frenzy through the ship. When the airship crashed into the outskirts of Alkenstar, its crew perished but the infected tangle survived to infect every trapjaw it met with the same deadly scrambling of magic. Now, trapjaw tangles are an even greater menace to society than the vermin they were originally designed to eradicate.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Trapjaw Tangle</span><span class=\"keepme\">Creature 5 </span></h2>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.outlaws-of-alkenstar-bestiary.ENCh6fX1xGwwrjCf]{See actor here}</p>\n"},"Ambrost Mugland":{"name":"Ambrost Mugland","text":"\n<h1 class=\"no-toc chapter-heading\">Ambrost Mugland<span class=\"subtitle\">Cutthroat Underworld Mogul</span></h1>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_AMBROST_MUGLAND.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_AMBROST_MUGLAND.webp');\">\n<p>Ambrost Mugland is one of the most powerful underworld kingpins in Alkenstar - at least to hear him tell it. In truth, he's a mid-level crime lord with an ego far larger than his coffers. In spite of his petty and delusional personality (or perhaps because of it), he's nonetheless a very dangerous man to cross. Mugland believes he's worked hard to get to where he is today, and he's grown used to having everything he feels he deserves: money, power, and infamy. His most strongly held conviction of all though, is that he's totally immune from any negative consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p>Mugland comes from humble beginnings but always had a taste for the finer things in life. His parents owned a tavern on the outskirts of posh Graeson's Fingers, and from an early age the boy practiced taking advantage of patrons too distracted or deep in their cups to notice the server boy picking their pockets. His mischief extended to extracurricular activities when he fell in with some friends his parents deemed \"undesirables\" cutpurses, cons, charlatans, and all the rest. He left home for good when he was just 12 years old to join one of Alkenstar's many nameless gangs of miscreant youths.</p>\n<p>Mugland swiftly built a reputation as one of the most ruthless go-getters in the city. He was a keen lookout and scout, known for his quick wits and feet; within a year, he was second in command. Shortly after that, the gang's leader was found dead in his room one night. Mugland assumed control and motivated his underlings with the promise of revenge. So spurred, Mugland and his goons set about enacting one of the grandest campaigns in Alkenstar's criminal underworld. They eliminated potential rivals, cut deals with corrupt shieldmarshals, cowed businesses into protection rackets, invested in unsavory businesses, and consolidated Mugland's control. At the apex of his power, he betrayed every last one of the minions who helped him ascend to the highest echelons of organized crime, leaving a river of blood in his wake.</p>\n<p>He can shed his public persona of the cunning businessman in an instant, revealing a cold-hearted killer devoid of mercy and regret. </p>\n<p>These days, Mugland is a silent partner in a number of successful inns and taverns in Alkenstar, brokering protection from one of his hired gangs in exchange for a cut of the take. He has repeatedly tried to bring Vivielle Ramslay and the Steaming Kingdom under his umbrella but has been rebuffed at every turn. Theft, extortion, and murder continue to be the tools of Mugland's trade - tools he wielded to dramatic effect against the protagonists of this Adventure Path shortly before launching on his latest criminal crusade.</p>\n<p>When Mugland witnessed Vashon Gattlebee's @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06pyronite000000]{Pyronite} exhibition at Blythir College, he knew he had to get his hands on the deadly new invention. To say nothing of what it could do for him personally should he wield it against his rivals, pyronite also promised Mugland a fortune in blood money if he could find the right buyers. With the help of his highest-ranking accomplice among the shieldmarshals, a corrupt deputy named Anjelique Loveless, Mugland located not one, but two customers: a Nexian and a Gebbite who both claimed to seek pyronite to bolster their side of the interminable war between their nations.</p>\n<p>Mugland's persistence has paid off in the past, but it seems his luck may have finally run out. He's all but gone bankrupt funding his pyronite scheme, which has been stymied at every turn by the betrayed outlaws he'd all but disregarded. It's too late to turn back, so Mugland continues to double down on his plans to seize pyronite, heedless of the potentially dire consequences.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h2>\n<p>Ambrost Mugland, along with Deputy Anjelique Loveless, the crooked high-ranking shieldmarshal he's (so far) kept in his pocket, functions as a common nemesis to unite the characters during their early adventures. The Outlaws of Alkenstar Player's Guide includes backgrounds that give the characters different reasons they might hold a grudge against this brutal business tycoon or Deputy Loveless, and the assumed personal impetus for much of this Adventure Path is to enact vengeance against this craven crook. Beyond these origin stories though, Mugland is also the chief instigator of the campaign's central events - it's by his hand that the secrets of pyronite are released to Alkenstar and, potentially, beyond. Unfortunately for Mugland, his grandiose pursuit ultimately cost him his entire fortune. After the characters stop the Gilded Gunners' assault on the Steaming Kingdom in Chapter 3 of this volume, Mugland has nowhere left to turn. He's forced to concede to the Gunners' demands, taking up residence with them until he can settle his debt.</p>\n<p>This precarious situation is what finally allows the party to corner Mugland and settle their score with their otherwise-untouchable archenemy. When the player characters meet the Gilded Gunners' leader, Sabora Sharkosa, in Chapter 4 of this adventure, they can either spend their hard-earned capital to strike a deal with her so she'll hand over Mugland peacefully, or they can fight their way through the Gilded Gunners to reach their target by force. Either way, Mugland - spiteful to the very end - doesn't go down without a fight.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Ambrost Mugland</span><span class=\"keepme\">Creature 8</span></h2>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.outlaws-of-alkenstar-bestiary.Wr08A69Iu5pXNWXj]{See actor here}</p>\n"},"Sabora Sharkosa":{"name":"Sabora Sharkosa","text":"\n<h1 class=\"no-toc chapter-heading\">Sabora Sharkosa<span class=\"subtitle\">Leader of the Gilded Gunners</span></h1>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_SABORA_SHARKOSA.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap179-cradle-of-quartz/assets/art/PZO90179_SABORA_SHARKOSA.webp');\">\n<p>Sabora Sharkosa was born on a ranch half a day's ride from Alkenstar in the harsh @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17905thespe.JournalEntryPage.05spellscardes00]{Spellscar Desert}. Though life was tough, she inherited her father's determination and her mother's fighting spirit. Growing up in the Mana Wastes gave her a pragmatic sense of honor and justice.</p>\n<p>One night, a stranger collapsed on the Sharkosas' doorstep, weak from days of stumbling through the wilderness. He carried a mysterious bundle in his burn-scarred hands. Asking no questions, the family took him in and nursed him back to health as they would any living being. The man, a gunsmith named Regaro, recovered and quickly became a fixture around the farm, repairing the clockwork machines and improving the ranch's vital wind pumps. He even taught Sabora and her brothers hand-to-hand fighting and how to shoot. Sabora proved to be his best student, often matching her brother's strength with her speed and technique.</p>\n<p>Then one night, the shieldmarshals of Alkenstar arrived. Regaro confessed to the family he was a wanted man and revealed a pair of gold-studded gloves in the bundle he'd been carrying the night he first appeared. He fled into the desert, the shieldmarshals on his heels. Sabora followed after. That was the last she ever saw of her home.</p>\n<p>Regaro and Sharkosa traveled together for many months until the gunsmith met his undignified end on the streets of Alkenstar, shot in the back by petty thieves. From that day on, Sharkosa wore Regaro's golden gloves on her fists and golden pistol in her holster. She assembled Regaro's closest allies to avenge their fallen friend, but the group stayed together even after justice had been dealt, with Sharkosa now their de facto leader. By the time they excavated a hideout along the banks of the Ustradi, the group had grown into a veritable street gang, though one known more for ruthless efficiency than wanton violence. To Sharkosa, the Gilded Gunners, as they soon called themselves, were never in it for the money or power, but rather the support and camaraderie they offered one another. For many members, the Gunners are as close to a real family as they've ever had, and Sharkosa takes this responsibility seriously.</p>\n<p>That said, Sharkosa is no saint and the Gilded Gunners aren't a charity. Back on the farm, workers who were lazy or sloppy didn't get hired for the next harvest. Sharkosa runs the Gilded Gunners with the same ethos, brooking no cowards, hypocrites, or slackers. Though she'll go to great lengths for Gunners who have proven their loyalty, she's also quick to berate or banish them if they step out of line or besmirch the honor of the group.</p>\n<p>As for the Gilded Gunners' goals: Sharkosa is primarily concerned about the strength and honor of her gang. She loans her group's skills to high-paying clients, mainly for assassinations or robberies, though Sharkosa rarely takes part in the jobs herself anymore. Instead, she administrates the Gilded Gunners' schemes from their headquarters, the so-called Gilded Halls, though she also trains for hours every day in isolation to maintain her incredible strength and speed.</p>\n<p>As she fights dummies and performs drills, part of her heart is always with Regaro and her family back in the Mana Wastes. She sometimes dreams of leaving the gang to go back home and live with her aging parents, but something dark and heavy within always prevents her from truly considering such a possibility. In her heart of hearts, Sharkosa believes she has spilled too much blood to ever again be worthy of her old life. Some nights, she lies awake in her spartan bed, staring up at the ceiling, questioning everything that has led to her present circumstances. During such dark hours, she commandeers the Gilded Halls' training area and puts everything she has into each punch and kick.</p>\n<p>The Gunners' gilded equipment and golden bullet casings are an aesthetic as well as a way of life. To Sharkosa, gold is the perfect status symbol and a mark of her gang's magnificence. In her own words, \"The gold standard always passes the acid test.\" Meaning, there are no shortcuts to success - only true grit can ever suffice.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h2>\n<p>The Gilded Gunners have been a recurring threat for the characters since the beginning of this Adventure Path, but Sharkosa herself only becomes a known quantity in the latter half of \"Cradle of Quartz.\" After her gang's failed siege on the Steaming Kingdom, the characters learn that Sharkosa's holding @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap17906advent.JournalEntryPage.06ambrostmugla00]{Ambrost Mugland} prisoner in the Gilded Gunners' hideout until he can pay off his debt to her. The time is finally right for the party to attack Mugland and get their sweet revenge, but Sharkosa stands in the way. A formidable combatant, she offers the characters a choice: they can either pay off Mugland's debt - in which case she'll gladly hand him over - or they can fight their way through her and her best lieutenants.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc split\"><span class=\"keepme\">Sabora Sharkosa</span><span class=\"keepme\">Creature 7

The water then splashes down into the sand, remaining as a long, thin swath of water that can provide a drinking source until it's soaked up or evaporates.","10-10":"Sudden Pit (conjuration, earth, primal) Reflex. A pit opens beneath a random creature. The pit is as wide as the creature's space, so the creature can Grab an Edge to avoid a fall. The pit is 20 feet deep per level of the mana storm and remains open even in terrain normally unable to support such a structure. After 1 hour, the pit vanishes and anything that fell in is restored to the surface.","11-11":"Befuddlement (arcane, emotion, enchantment, mental) Will. A number of creatures up to the level of the mana storm within a radius of 10 feet per level become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} for 1 round per level.","12-12":"Death Field (necromancy, primal) Fortitude. Normal vegetation within a radius of 10 feet per level immediately dies and turns to ash. Plant creatures take [[/r 2d6]] damage per level of the mana storm (basic Fortitude save).","13-13":"Strangers to All (arcane, curse, enchantment, mental, misfortune) Will. A number of creatures up to the level of the mana storm within a radius of 10 feet per level are affected by @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.KSAEhNfZyXMO7Z7V]{Outcast's Curse}.","14-15":"Weird Rain (conjuration, primal) A rain of small objects (anything from flowers to rotten fruit) pelts an area with a radius of 10 feet per level of the mana storm for a number of rounds equal to the level. This rain doesn't harm creatures in the area. Creatures in the area have concealment. The objects remain even after the rain is over.","16-17":"Wellspring (primal, varies) The mana storm draws magical potential from deep within a random creature. That creature rolls 1d20 and uses the @Compendium[pf2e.rollable-tables.N0pDFNCffTe2Du39]{Wellspring Surges} Table to determine a wellspring effect.","18-19":"Wondrous Effect (arcane, evocation) Randomly choose one creature to be a \"wielder\" and a different random creature to be a \"target.\" Roll d% on the @Compendium[pf2e.rollable-tables.uYDzWM5ji52r4mSD]{Rod of Wonder} table to determine what sort of strange effect occurs between the creatures.","20-20":"Double Strength (varies) Reroll two results on the @RollTable[MEMyVpNP9lImb9je]{Mana Storm Effects} Table and apply both in the order rolled; further results of 20 on these rerolls have no effect."}}},"macros":{"Hoodoo Field Ambush":"Hoodoo Field Ambush","Gilded Halls Portcullis":"Gilded Halls Portcullis","Smithy open trap door":"Smithy open trap door","Gilded Halls Color Spray Trap":"Gilded Halls Color Spray Trap","Ulfen Funeral Ship reveal tunnel":"Ulfen Funeral Ship reveal tunnel","Steaming Kingdom Trap":"Steaming Kingdom Trap","Gilded Halls Mugland's Move":"Gilded Halls Mugland's Move","Gilded Halls False Door Trap":"Gilded Halls False Door Trap","Globally Toggle Roof Occlusion Mode":"Globally Toggle Roof Occlusion Mode","Steaming Kingdom Rubble":"Steaming Kingdom Rubble","Landing Screen Picker":"Landing Screen Picker","Smithy Pull Rug":"Smithy Pull Rug","Steaming Kingdom Vault":"Steaming Kingdom Vault","Steaming Kingdom Trapdoor":"Steaming Kingdom Trapdoor"},"cards":{},"playlists":{"Ambiances":{"name":"Ambiances","sounds":{"Asynchronous Archives":{"name":"Asynchronous Archives"},"Kosowana's Workshop":{"name":"Kosowana's Workshop"},"Airship Inside":{"name":"Airship Inside"},"Airship Outside":{"name":"Airship Outside"},"Engine Noises":{"name":"Engine Noises"},"Mana Storm":{"name":"Mana Storm"},"Spellscar Desert":{"name":"Spellscar Desert"},"Ulfen Funeral Ship":{"name":"Ulfen Funeral Ship"},"Cradle of Quartz":{"name":"Cradle of Quartz"},"Flooded Room":{"name":"Flooded Room"},"Steaming Kingdom":{"name":"Steaming Kingdom"},"Div Assassin Battle":{"name":"Div Assassin Battle"},"Gunshots!":{"name":"Gunshots!"},"Gilded Halls":{"name":"Gilded Halls"}}},"Sound Effects":{"name":"Sound Effects","sounds":{"Quartz Clock":{"name":"Quartz Clock"},"Engine Sputtering":{"name":"Engine Sputtering"},"Airship Crash":{"name":"Airship Crash"},"Explosive Steam Trap":{"name":"Explosive Steam Trap"},"Pyronite Explosion":{"name":"Pyronite Explosion"},"Smithy Trapdoor Alarm":{"name":"Smithy Trapdoor Alarm"},"False Door exploding Trap":{"name":"False Door exploding Trap"},"Falling Portcullis Trap":{"name":"Falling Portcullis Trap"}}}},"folders":{"Cradle of Quartz":"Cradle of Quartz","Chapter 2: Searching the Spellscar":"Chapter 2: Searching the Spellscar","The Second Kiss":"The Second Kiss","Ulfen Funeral Ship":"Ulfen Funeral Ship","Meeting I":"Meeting I","Haunted Gun":"Haunted Gun","Hoodoo Field":"Hoodoo Field","Chapter 4: The Steaming Kingdom":"Chapter 4: The Steaming Kingdom","The Gilded Halls":"The Gilded Halls","The Steaming Kingdom":"The Steaming Kingdom","Chapter 1: The High Priest’s Puzzle":"Chapter 1: The High Priest’s Puzzle","Asynchronous Archives":"Asynchronous Archives","Kosowana's Workshop":"Kosowana's Workshop","Chapter 3: The Cradle of Quartz":"Chapter 3: The Cradle of Quartz","Treasure":"Treasure","Ch. 1 The High Priests Puzzle":"Ch. 1 The High Priests Puzzle","Ch. 4 The Steaming Kingdom":"Ch. 4 The Steaming Kingdom","Ch. 3 The Cradle of Quartz":"Ch. 3 The Cradle of Quartz","Ch. 2 Searching the Spellscar":"Ch. 2 Searching the Spellscar","Scenes (Original)":"Scenes (Original)","Outlaws of Alkenstar":"Outlaws of Alkenstar"}}}}
