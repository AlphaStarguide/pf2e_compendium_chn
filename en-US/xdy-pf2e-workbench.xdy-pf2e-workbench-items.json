You don't need to remove runes from weapons and armor if you don't want to, these REs are implemented as Item Bonuses, so whichever of the rune and the character has the highest bonus is applied, <em>except</em> for Devastating Attacks which *does* stack with Striking Runes. (I used the Abadar icon as, well, I just discussed the campaign economy in the previous sentence, so, it felt appropriate. :)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
