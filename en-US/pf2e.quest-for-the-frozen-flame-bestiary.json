            "publicNotes": "<p>Inhabitants of damp, subterranean caves, blindheims resemble stubby humanoids with oversized, frog-like heads and bulbous eyes. Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.</p>\n<p>Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.</p>\n<p>It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as \"raid frogs,\" placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.</p>",

            "publicNotes": "<p>With a blunt, prehensile trunk and a squat posture, giant tapirs resemble a cross between elephant and boar, though they're actually more closely related to horses and rhinoceroses. Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores-which they eat in prodigious quantities- but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes.</p>\n<p>Humanoids often hunt giant tapirs for their meat and durable hides. Such hunts are far from guaranteed, though; tapirs can run at least as fast as their hunters, and most will fight if cornered. The docile giants do what they can to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If they sense danger approaching, giant tapirs make a loud whistling sound to warn other tapirs about predators. A community who befriends or domesticates a herd of tapirs can use this whistling habit as an alarm system against encroaching enemies.</p>\n<p>Giant tapirs are usually quite placid, but they can be fearsome when roused. Their tusk-like front teeth are suitable for gouging attackers, and a tapir that manages to get a mouthful of an enemy's arm or leg can use its blunt molars to grind the flesh to paste. Tapirs have good hearing and an excellent sense of smell, but like many prey animals, they have poor vision. In the chaos of combat against multiple enemies, giant tapirs can become overwhelmed and confused, lashing out at allies as well as foes or fleeing the scene entirely.</p>",

Surly and suspicious, glyptodons avoid predators not out of a defensive instinct-their armored hides protect them from most well-equipped carnivores-but rather because they simply prefer to be left alone to their placid foraging. Despite their great size, glyptodons can survive on surprisingly little food, and they'll eat just about anything. As a result, they're more likely to be encountered roaming across vast tundra or desert regions than other large herbivores, appearing as a single, lumbering hump against an otherwise-flat horizon.</p>\n<p>A glyptodon's scutes-the thick, bony plates of its carapace-grow in distinctive patterns and scar readily, making it easy for non-glyptodons to identify individual animals. Glyptodons have notoriously bad eyesight, even for prey animals, and rely on their sense of smell to get around and identify threats and each other. In combat, they primarily rely on their thick carapaces to protect them from attackers.</p>\n<p>Although southern merchants have occasionally attempted to create a glyptodon-mounted trading network, riding these giants is an exercise in frustration, as their rounded hides provide little purchase for humanoid riders' feet or saddles. However, some webbed-toed people of the plains, including bands of lizardfolk, have managed to maintain glyptodon mounts thanks to their strong, flexible, clawed feet. Other ancestries primarily view glyptodons as a source of meat and tough hides, the latter of which make for excellent impromptu shelters and river boats.</p>\n<p>When cornered, a glyptodon uses its powerful digging claws to scrape or scare away attackers. Glyptodons can use their tails to ward off smaller predators, but generally do so only as a last resort.</p>",

Its rear legs are more muscular than those in front, which it primarily uses for balance, giving it the gait and appearance of a toad. Groplits are best known for their greasy skin and queasy hygienic habits: they spend most of each day using their two long tongues to slurp up their own oily excretions or similarly viscous discharge originating from plants or other animals. Although they prefer to dwell in northern wetlands, fens, and moist caves, groplits can thrive in all but the most barren environments. They'll eat just about anything, though they tend to prefer small, crunchy animals like bugs and birds.</p>\n<p>Groplits are famously loyal and highly sociable companions, and they make for dedicated, if somewhat odd-looking, pets. They can be taught simple commands and appear to take great pride in obeying them, performing stunts even in the face of obvious danger. An unscrupulous master might train a groplit with the intent to sacrifice it in an emergency, a fate to which the groplit is happily resigned. This single-minded obedience and their slow reproductive rate make groplits fairly rare in the wild.</p>\n<p>As a result of the way their bones are structured, groplits exhibit an imperturbable smile, of sorts-a physical feature which some find as creepy (or enraging) as others find it endearing. Its apparently ceaseless jubilation has given this creature the nickname \"the grinning toad\" in some parts of the world.</p>\n<p>Because they love to lap up oily matter of all kinds, groplits are naturally drawn to greasy animals like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.tashopA1s2fAbSXA]{Slurks}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.g1htYgARxNKxc7MV]{Giant Slugs}, and lagofirs. For the most part, such animals rarely mind the company of an amiable groplit, though there's no such thing as a free meal; groplits who drop their guard amid their found family often end up on the wrong side of their companions' intestinal tracts.</p>",

Tapirs live in loose herds that graze near rivers and lakes. They enjoy fresh water, not only for the lush plants that grow along the shores-which they eat in prodigious quantities- but also for the protection the water provides. When predators approach, tapirs retreat to the water to hide, keeping their snouts barely above the surface to breathe. Likewise, the breezes and scents that accompany creeks and rivers mask tapirs' musk as they travel along these waterways. Despite their ungainly movement, tapirs are remarkably sure-footed, easily traversing mud and similar terrain thanks to their broad toes.</p>\n<p>Humanoids often hunt giant tapirs for their meat and durable hides. Such hunts are far from guaranteed, though; tapirs can run at least as fast as their hunters, and most will fight if cornered. The docile giants do what they can to avoid confrontation whenever possible. If they sense danger approaching, giant tapirs make a loud whistling sound to warn other tapirs about predators. A community who befriends or domesticates a herd of tapirs can use this whistling habit as an alarm system against encroaching enemies.</p>\n<p>Giant tapirs are usually quite placid, but they can be fearsome when roused. Their tusk-like front teeth are suitable for gouging attackers, and a tapir that manages to get a mouthful of an enemy's arm or leg can use its blunt molars to grind the flesh to paste. Tapirs have good hearing and an excellent sense of smell, but like many prey animals, they have poor vision. In the chaos of combat against multiple enemies, giant tapirs can become overwhelmed and confused, lashing out at allies as well as foes or fleeing the scene entirely.</p>",

These itinerant folk have an innate curiosity about the woodlands in which they dwell, and rarely stop to take root and rest in the same part of the forest twice. This wanderlust makes wardens ideal forest patrollers and scouts. While they are robust combatants, they know better than to confront dangerous foes on their own. Instead, they report any dangers to arboreal regents. In rare cases, large groups of arboreal wardens congregate to form a copse. Copses travel beyond the boundaries of a forest to investigate the hinterlands and gather intelligence on potential threats before returning to report their findings. Arboreal wardens do not pretend to understand to other creatures' motives-like most forces of the natural world, they are ambivalent about mortal affairs that do not involve their forest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Arboreals are guardians of the forest and representatives of the trees. As long-lived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to fight in defense of the woods. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of short-lived folk-even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals-and have an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands. Against those who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals' wrath is unwavering and devastating. Perhaps ironically, arboreals are gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves vengeful members of their kind well.</p>",
