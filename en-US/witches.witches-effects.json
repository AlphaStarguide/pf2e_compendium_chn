            "description": "<p>Granted by @UUID[Compendium.witches.witches-feats.3Cp2WF4keYMXScaO]{Bargain Soul}.</p>\n<p>You've earned enough respect in the eyes of your patron to now be able to broker additional minor pacts with them. You can offer a portion of your life energy to your patron in exchange for greater power. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed 1} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained 1} conditions or increase these values by 1 if you already had them, and a -1 circumstance penalty to death effects. In exchange, you can regain a spell slot at least one level lower than your highest spell level, and you regain a focus point as if you'd @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocused}. These penalties last until your next daily preparations and cannot be removed by any means. If you die while under the effects of your patron's bargain, your soul is forfeit, likely turned into an extraplanar creature with no memories of your last life to further your patron's agendas more directly. You can only be resurrected if your patron is contacted and bargained with before you can be restored via resurrection or other magic.</p>"
