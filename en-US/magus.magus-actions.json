			"description": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell or make a melee Spellstrike.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You don your visage, granting you a fearsome, jovial, or mysterious demeanor. Choose between fearsome, jovial, or mysterious for the demeanor of your visage and attempt an @Check[arcana|dc:@self.level] check at a standard-difficulty DC of your level to don your visage. If you succeed at your check, you don your visage for 3 rounds, or 4 rounds if your result was a critical success. When you first use Don Visage in an encounter, you can use the result of your initial check to perform the associated skill action of your demeanor against an appropriate creature. For the duration, you can use your visage to perform the associated actions with your Arcana instead of the normal skill. You deal 1 additional damage of the same type as the arcane cascade stance to creatures as long as they are affected by the associated action from your visage. This damage increases to 2 if you have weapon specialization or to 3 if you have greater weapon specialization.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n<li><strong>Fearsome</strong> Your skill action is @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-macros.Macro.0CUA0IoROLfIKCEq]{Demoralize}. When you use your visage to Demoralize it gains the visual trait and loses the linguistic and auditory traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Jovial</strong> Your skill action is @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-macros.Macro.KeRdZBkxJGLLYhTN]{Bon Mot}, and you can use Bon Mot even if you do not have the skill feat. It gains the visual trait and loses the linguistic and auditory traits, but your opponent only needs to use a single action with the concentrate trait to retort.</li>\n<li><strong>Mysterious</strong> Your skill actions are @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-macros.Macro.ktRy5et6OdHTO4vN]{Feint}, @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-macros.Macro.7gPdrGtDD8eh51kr]{Hide}, and @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-macros.Macro.uSOQA4j55M11rK4k]{Sneak}. You gain the additional damage from Don Visage against creatures that are off-guard to you as a result of these actions or being undetected or unnoticed.</li>\n</ul>"

			"name": "Arcane Cascade: Puppet String",
			"description": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell that targeted an enemy within 30 feet or make a melee Spellstrike and the spell you chose had the illusion or mental trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Grants</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:none\">\n<li><strong>To You</strong> @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-effects.Item.D2ZV2vHptH3jsfzr]{Effect: Arcane Cascade: Puppet String}</li>\n<li><strong>To Enemies </strong>@UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-effects.Item.ub4NOlXIkOJtUUpR]{Effect: Tethered (Puppet String)}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>You weave magic around your enemy, making them more susceptible to mental manipulation. You create a thread of magic between yourself and the required enemy, tethering them by a puppet string made from the lingering magic of your spell. This puppet string is broken if a creature spends an Interact action to break it or you and the tethered creature are further than 30 feet from each other. While tethered, your target takes a –1 status penalty to their Will saves against your spells with the required traits and they gain weakness 1 to mental damage from your spells. This weakness increases to 2 if you have weapon specialization, or 3 if you have greater weapon specialization.</p>"

You Step. You can perform this Step during a Spellstrike between when you Cast the Spell and when you Strike, but your Step must be towards the target of your Spellstrike or to a square that keeps the target in your reach if you were already within melee reach of the target.</p>"

This creates an area of ambient magic that lasts for 2 rounds. The area of ambient magic occupies the target’s space or the area of effect of the spell you cast. Creatures other than you that end their turn within an area of ambient magic take damage equal to the level of the spell you cast with a  @Check[fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.attributes.spellDC.value)|basic] save against your spell DC, or half that amount if the spell you cast was a cantrip (minimum 1). This damage is of the same type as the arcane cascade stance. The ambient magic lasts for 3 rounds if you have weapon specialization, or 4 rounds if you have greater weapon specialization.</p>"

Any Strike that benefits from this damage gains the arcane trait, making it magical.</p>\n<p>If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is instead the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).</p>"

When you would enter your @UUID[Compendium.magus.magus-class-features.Item.SkUkDSnIU1LHBSHf]{Arcane Cascade} stance, you enter a Havok Cascade stance, a powerful enhancement to your bolstered essences that follows all the same rules as your Arcane Cascade, but with the additional effects of your Bargained Essences.
