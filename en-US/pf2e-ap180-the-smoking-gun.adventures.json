This might feel like a dramatic twist considering the characters’ ignominious beginnings as vengeance-seeking bank robbers.</p>\n<p>Your players’ dispositions and play styles will obviously impact their feelings about this turn of fate. Some players might sigh in relief as their character is redeemed in the eyes of the public. Others might wish to retain their character’s hard-won hard-boiled reputation.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, “The Smoking Gun” includes a diverse array of motivations for undertaking the adventure’s final chapters. Those who want to save Alkenstar for moral reasons might require no further impetus, while mercenary-minded adventurers can rest assured that their efforts will be well compensated. Furthermore, saving the day offers a pragmatic solution to a problem that’s hounded the characters since the campaign’s start: their criminal status. The grand duchess herself promises that if the party stops Loveless’s plot, she’ll pardon them of their past crimes. No matter what a character intends to do with their newly won freedom, it’s hard to deny that a clean slate opens countless doors in the City of Smog.</p>\n</aside>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc contents\">Chapter 1: Arms Race</h1>\n<p>Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia approaches the characters directly and explains that the situation has become dire. To find @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06anjeliquelov00]{Loveless} and the pyronite buyers, the party must investigate Loveless’s headquarters in the shieldmarshals’ Vault of Secrets and rescue Alkenstar citizens who knew too much about the deputy’s schemes. The party’s best lead takes them to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18005thegun.JournalEntryPage.05thegunworks000]{The Gunworks} far west of Alkenstar, where they learn about their enemies’ plot to use pyronite to level Alken Falls.</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc contents\">Chapter 2: Alkenstar Falls</h1>\n<p>Around Alken Falls, their investigation leads the characters to the Tinwound Hydroforge, where Parsus has used necromantic powers to fill the water purification plant with undead minions. The party must navigate electrified undead, clockwork monstrosities, and dangerous technology to find and defeat Parsus, who reveals that Loveless and Ibrium are on a luxury riverboat headed right this way, pyronite in hand.</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc contents\">Chapter 3: Blood in the Bilge</h1>\n<p>To save the day, the outlaws board a high-society riverboat called the Gearsmoke as it cruises down the Ustradi. The vessel is loaded with volatile pyronite, so the party must sneak around to disarm the bombs before finally facing off against Deputy Loveless and Ibrium, upending the villains’ plot once and for all.</p>\n<section class=\"advancement-track\">\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Advancement Track</h1>\n<p>“The Smoking Gun” is designed for four characters.</p>\n<p><span class=\"level\">8</span>\nCharacters should begin this adventure at 8th level.</p>\n<p><span class=\"level\">9</span>\nCharacters should advance to 9th level before Chapter 2.</p>\n<p><span class=\"level\">10</span>\nCharacters should advance to 10th level before Chapter 3.</p>\n<p><span class=\"level\">11</span>\nThe characters should reach 11th level after completing the adventure.</p>\n</section>"},"Next Month":{"name":"Next Month","text":"<h1 class=\"no-toc chapter-heading\"><span class=\"keepme\">Next Month</span></h1>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Zombie Feast</h2>\n    <p><em>by Mike Kimmel</em></p>\n    <p>When things go wrong on one of Geb’s zombie‑worked farms, novice troubleshooters discover that the rot goes deep.

Synopsis</h1>\n    <p>At the beginning of this adventure, Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia herself approaches the characters and explains the situation has become dire. Pyronite isn’t only in the hands of the characters’ arch-rival Anjelique Loveless, but Mugland managed to sell the formula to buyers before the characters defeated him at the end of the previous adventure.</p>\n    <p>In this chapter, the characters must track down the elusive Deputy Loveless and the pyronite buyers. To do so, they must first investigate Loveless’s headquarters in the shieldmarshals’ Vault of Secrets. The investigation takes the party to a lavish gala in one of the city’s highest towers where they meet high-rollers who can clue them into Loveless’s ultimate motives.</p>\n    <p>Finally, the characters must traverse the city to rescue citizens on Loveless’s hit list. This takes the party to the infamous firearms manufactory outside the city’s walls, the Gunworks. Here, the party must earn the garrison commander’s trust by resolving mysteries and defending the Gunworks from a wasteland war horde’s assault. All the while, a tempestuous mana storm rages on.</p>\n</aside>\n<p>At the end of the last adventure, the characters exacted vengeance on the malevolent mogul Ambrost Mugland. Some of them though may still bear a grudge toward Deputy @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06anjeliquelov00]{Anjelique Loveless}, whose machinations have been a thorn in the party’s side since the outlaws first came together. Furthermore, pyronite has fallen into far more dangerous hands than even Mugland’s. @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06parsus00000000]{Parsus} and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06ibrium00000000]{Ibrium}, powerful spellcasters from Geb and Nex respectively, have purchased the explosive’s formula for their own mysterious ends. Loveless—who is nowhere to be found—is the only one with the information necessary to find the buyers. With the cat thoroughly out of the bag, the leader of Alkenstar, Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia, is worried it may be only a matter of time before the secrets of pyronite are disseminated throughout the entire Inner Sea region. </p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to Ricia, Loveless has, in tandem with Parsus and Ibrium, already solicited the manufacture of a large quantity of pyronite. They plan to blow up Alken Falls and eliminate Alkenstar’s heavily monitored mechanical ship lift system, the Screw. In the process, they’ll sow chaos throughout the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar and create a new, faster waterway for shipping troops and goods across the Mana Wastes.</p>\n<p>The obvious question for this nefarious plot is: why? </p>\n<p>Ibrium and Parsus know a quicker route along the Ustradi would be invaluable for both sides in case war between their two nations resumes, and they’d stand to make a good profit from their sponsors across the borders. Even if war doesn’t break out between Nex and Geb, the two will at least get to see what their newly purchased weapon of mass destruction is really capable of. </p>\n<p>For Loveless’s part, the twisted deputy has always yearned for greater power within shieldmarshal hierarchy, and this development poses a unique opportunity to grasp the authority she believes she deserves. Up until now, all her power grabs have been stymied by (legitimate) accusations of corruption. But if a devastating explosion rocks the very foundations of her city, few will be able to argue against stronger, stricter shieldmarshal legislation—legislation which, conveniently, would place her in charge. If all goes according to Loveless’s plan, mandatory conscription will become the norm in Alkenstar and she will lead this new army of shieldmarshals as a general. With so much power at her disposal, she could change the fate of Alkenstar forever. </p>"},"Getting Started":{"name":"Getting Started","text":"<p>The previous adventure, “Cradle of Quartz,” ended with the characters finally exacting their revenge on Ambrost Mugland. After hearing the news, Foebe Dunsmith asks the characters to meet at the Barrel &amp; Bullet Saloon just before dawn the following day to discuss the future of pyronite and Alkenstar.

Behind the hat sits a woman wearing unassuming, yet fine, clothes embroidered with the crest of Alkenstar.</p>\n<p>With a deferential bow and a murmur of, “My lady,” Foebe Dunsmith closes the door, ensuring this meeting is private.</p>\n<p>Rising from her seat, Grand Duchess Trietta Ricia dons her hat and leans over the table. She arches an eyebrow before speaking. “Agent Dunsmith has kept me appraised of your efforts regarding the pyronite situation. I’d hoped the trail might end with Mugland, but it seems Deputy Loveless is still at large with the pyronite formula, along with two new faces—wizards from Geb and Nex named Parsus and Ibrium, respectively. Obviously, the implications of this discovery are dire.</p>\n<p>“Pyronite is too powerful a weapon for one nation to wield alone,” Ricia continues. “If the formula can’t be kept secret here in Alkenstar, I fear it must be spread to all nations equally. The political situation between Nex and Geb is tenuous, to say nothing of nations more distant from Alkenstar. If any single power were to gain access to pyronite, they would gain a devastating advantage in matters of war. To prevent this, I’ve begun preparations to distribute the pyronite formula to as many foreign powers as necessary, including the hands of unscrupulous nations close to home such as Nex and Geb. Take a moment to let that set in.”</p>\n<p>Ricia paces the room slowly and speaks methodically. “With all nations ensured equal access to this new weapon, the current balance of power will be preserved. At the moment, my hands are tied and the world will be forever changed because of Gattlebee’s devastating invention.”</p>\n<p>She stops pacing and looks up from the floor. “There’s still a small chance to avoid this, however. If you can find Loveless, Parsus, and Ibrium, you could prevent the formula from spreading further. This is my preferred solution by far. Obviously, Alkenstar would be in a far safer position if no one—or, at least, only our own nation—had access to this powerful new weapon.”</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ricia gauges the characters’ reaction to her news and offers to answer any questions they might have. The following are a few of the party’s most likely questions, along with Ricia’s replies.</p>\n<p><strong>Where do we start looking?</strong> “At present, we know little about Parsus or Ibrium, so the trail ends with Loveless, who’s also nowhere to be found. While we don’t know their plans, in order to use the pyronite formula, the trio will need large quantities of the necessary reagents to craft the explosives. This means they need funding, material, transportation—all things that can be tracked. As a first step, I need you to infiltrate the Ironmaster’s Vault of Secrets, where Loveless and her cronies have their offices. Hopefully, you can find some clues there.” Dunsmith can provide the party with more info about the Vault of Secrets after the grand duchess departs (see @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18001armsra.JournalEntryPage.01intothevault00]{here}).</p>\n<p><strong>Why us? Shouldn’t Alkenstar’s best be working on this?</strong> “Loveless has many allies, both high and low, who’ve already stymied my official efforts. Even aside from the risk of alerting Loveless to our plans, Alkenstar’s bureaucracy is... formidable. Our city is like a lumbering engine set on a track: it’s difficult to slow down and even more difficult to change directions. For nimble adjustments, I’ve found unorthodox solutions—such as agents like you—are far more effective. So far your efforts have been outstanding, which is why I’ve selected you for this important mission.”</p>\n<p><strong>What’s in it for us?</strong> “Apart from averting an international disaster and saving Alkenstar? Money, of course. Reputation, for another—or should I say ‘redemption’? Let me put it simply: if you’re successful, I will personally ensure you’re amply rewarded. Moreover, my political powers are significant. For complying with my requests, I can absolve you of the laws you’ve thus far broken, including any damage to your status Mugland or Loveless may have inflicted. I can also help you out of binds in the future—within reason, of course.”</p>\n<p>Once she’s answered all of their questions, Grand Duchess Ricia excuses herself and leaves Dunsmith to discuss the particulars of the party’s mission.</p>"},"Into the Vault of Secrets":{"name":"Into the Vault of Secrets","text":"<p>The party’s first step toward finding Loveless, Dunsmith explains, is to infiltrate the Vault of Secrets—a secret underground fortress from which Alkenstar’s shieldmarshals operate. The Vault has several entrances, all known only to vetted shieldmarshals and national defense bureaucrats. Luckily, Dunsmith and Ricia have arranged a way for the characters to gain access to one of these entrances. Dunsmith outlines the characters’ mission as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Hijack the stagecoach.</strong> From time to time, shieldmarshals act as armed escorts for Alkenstar, transporting government cargo across the harsh wasteland outside the city walls. An armored stagecoach accompanied by four shieldmarshals is scheduled to return from the town of Martel later this afternoon. To gain access to the Vault of Secrets, the characters will need to sneak aboard the stagecoach, either by stowing away or staging a stickup. The stagecoach is pulled by a pair of mindless clockwork steeds programmed to take the coach into the Vault of Secrets regardless of who’s aboard. </li>\n    <li><strong>Find info on Loveless.</strong> Once the characters are inside the Vault, they can collect info on Loveless. Dunsmith suggests they keep an eye out for suspicious paperwork which might indicate Loveless’s whereabouts, her most recent dealings with Alkenstar power brokers, or the names of potential accomplices.</li>\n    <li><strong>Escape undetected.</strong> The Vault of Secrets is crawling with shieldmarshals, both good and bad. Fighting their way out simply isn’t an option. “I’ve no doubt you can handle a few of Loveless’s goons,” Dunsmith says, “but don’t stick around any longer than you have to. Escape the way you came, and don’t look back.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dunsmith is able to provide a few additional details about the stagecoach. It’s crewed by four shieldmarshals; two, named Otto and Lillie, are toughened warriors believed to be associated with Loveless and capable of putting up a real fight. The other two, Payton and Oakley, are shieldmarshal bookkeepers responsible for auditing, managing the Vault stockpiles, and other financial affairs—these two are unlikely to be involved in Loveless’s schemes, and so Dunsmith asks the characters to refrain from using lethal force against them.</p>\n<p>Many of Loveless’s lower-level lackeys have taken to wearing pins or getting tattoos that depict a broken heart to signify to other shieldmarshals they enjoy the fearsome deputy’s favor and protection. Once the characters are inside the vaults, they should keep an eye out for any shieldmarshals matching this description, then tail them to Loveless’s offices if they can’t locate them on their own. Loveless and her closest minions operate out of Vault 14, which should be right next to the hangar where the stagecoach stops.</p>"},"Event 1: Stagecoach Heist":{"name":"Event 1: Stagecoach Heist","text":"<p>The stagecoach Dunsmith described arrives at Alkenstar from Martel shortly after noon, entering the city in the Ferrous Quarter and rambling through the streets to a warehouse in Steamhaven.

Likewise, Otto and Lillie holster their guns and lounge on the roof, chit-chatting.

His professionalism and discipline have the made the Leadsmiths into a powerful organization with the support of many wealthy nobles. </p>\n<p>Before she left, Loveless made sure Vewslog had descriptions of each character. However, she was also sure to give him strict orders to avoid open bloodshed at the gala; such violence might cause her to lose the support of her high society backers. </p>\n<p><strong>Art Critique:</strong> Not long after the gala begins, Vewslog begins to worry the characters will get too much information out of Tombend, especially if they approach her directly. To head them off and cause a distraction, he whispers to Tombend that the characters are famous art critics and asks her to introduce them. She steps into the center of the room and claps her hands, announcing that the characters are her special guests. She asks if they would honor her by providing an artistic analysis for the gala’s attendees. Tombend directs the party to a large statue of metal and glass that resembles a scintillating jellyfish made from cubic blocks. The crowd falls silent and steps back from the characters, making them the center of attention for the entire ballroom.</p>\n<p>Each character can explain their reaction and make a skill check to deal with the situation. For example, characters can offer an intriguing critique of the art with a successful @Check[type:art-lore|dc:24]{Art Lore} check, or they can bluff their way through the encounter with a successful @Check[type:society|dc:26] or @Check[type:deception|dc:26] check. Each character who rolls a successful check to publicly resolve the situation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Society checks for the remainder of the gala. Alternatively, characters who succeed at a @Check[type:stealth|dc:29] or @Check[type:deception|dc:29] check can surreptitiously sneak away, cause a distraction, or otherwise excuse themselves from the situation, though in this case they don’t gain the aforementioned circumstance bonus.</p>\n<p>While this is happening, two Leadsmiths approach Christia Tombend and attempt to escort her to the elevator and out of the party. Tombend is flustered about being forced to leave her own gala but acquiesces. If a character catches up to her before she leaves, they can convince her to stay with a successful @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:19] check. In this case, she orders the Leadsmiths away and gaily rejoins the party, to Vewslog’s dismay.</p>\n<p><strong>Gathering Information:</strong> In order to find out the details of Loveless’s plan the characters must interview the gala’s guests. The following are a few examples of suitable guests; feel free to devise your own as well. </p>\n<p><strong>Christia Tombend:</strong> Tombend is the best source of information for the characters, if they can keep her at the party. She’s an ardent nationalist who believes Alkenstar should be much more than just a great city–it should be a great nation! She’s donated significant funds to Loveless and happily reveals clues about her plans to any characters who succeed at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:19|traits:action:make-an-impression] check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OX4fy22hQgUHDr0q]{Make an Impression} on her.</p>\n<p><strong>Powle Guthroy:</strong> An avid art enthusiast, Guthroy has snuck several bottles of @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.26bM70yn28MjDT9A]{Elven Absinthe} into the party, which he claims help him see the artwork as it truly exists. Characters can gather clues from him by drinking the absinthe and succeeding at a @Check[type:society|dc:24] or @Check[type:art-lore|dc:24]{Art Lore} check to discuss the art. </p>\n<p><strong>Helain Maudele:</strong> This whimsical dance instructor believes the body is a form of art all on its own. Characters can gather clues from Maudele by succeeding at a @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:24] or @Check[type:athletics|dc:24] check to demonstrate their physical grace. </p>\n<p><strong>Professor Hoop:</strong> A scholar of both the magical and mechanical, Professor Hoop roams about the party looking bored stiff. If the characters can impress her with a successful @Check[type:arcana|dc:24|traits:action:recall-knowledge], @Check[type:religion|dc:24|traits:action:recall-knowledge], @Check[type:occultism|dc:24|traits:action:recall-knowledge], or @Check[type:engineering-lore|dc:24|traits:action:recall-knowledge]{Engineering Lore} check to Recall Knowledge, she calls over her wife Theome, who is an avid gossip and can provide the characters with one or more clues. </p>\n<p><strong>Clues:</strong> Before the characters leave the gala, they should learn the following clues from Christia Tombend or the other guests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tombend purchased an enormous number of firearms (enough to outfit an army) and donated them to the shieldmarshals. </li>\n<li>Tombend is gathering support for a bill that would enact mandatory conscription within Alkenstar, forcing 20% of all citizens to be part of a standing army at any given time. This army would be placed under the control of a high-ranking shieldmarshal. Deputy Anjelique Loveless, as a senior officer with decades of experience and a history of command, would be a prime contender for the role. </li>\n<li>The conscription bill currently faces dim prospects as many feel the shieldmarshals and Alkenstar’s other defenses (like @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18005thegun.JournalEntryPage.05thegunworks000]{The Gunworks's} massive cannon, the Maw of Rovagug) are more than enough to defend the lands of Alkenstar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these clues, the gala is also a great opportunity to reveal some background information about @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06anjeliquelov00]{Loveless}, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06ibrium00000000]{Ibrium}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06parsus00000000]{Parsus}, contextualizing these villains’ histories and foreshadowing their abilities and personalities.

If they don’t come to the idea themselves, Garrison Commander Ayton roars orders at the characters, telling them to fire the cannon at the incoming horde to demoralize the advance war band.</p>\n<p><strong>Firing the Cannon:</strong> Typically the Maw of Rovagug is operated by a crew of nine, with each member of the crew performing one skill check each round. In a pinch, a minimum of three people can fire the cannon, performing three skill checks per round each. Doing this is difficult, however; a character performing multiple skill checks in a single round takes a –1 penalty to the second check and a –2 penalty to the third check. If the party needs additional help, both Della Sangrey and Erdrik Marth are nearby. Although they avoid fighting, each has a skill check modifier of +18 for Crafting and Engineering Lore and gladly helps fire the cannon. </p>\n<p>The Maw of Rovagug can be used to target any point within 100 miles, affecting a 60-foot burst around the point of impact. The damage dealt by the Maw of Rovagug depends on the number of successful checks the crew rolls while firing the cannon. For each successful check, the cannon deals 2d6 fire and 2d6 bludgeoning damage; these amounts are doubled for critically successful checks. For example, if the crew succeeds at all nine checks to fire the cannon, it deals 18d6 fire and 18d6 bludgeoning damage in a 60-foot burst. Firing the cannon occurs in three phases, with each phase requiring three DC 22 skill checks. Following are suggested skills for each phase of firing the cannon, but feel free to allow the characters to use different skills or class abilities if it seems appropriate. </p>\n<p><strong>Load Ammo (@Check[type:crafting|dc:22|name:Load Ammo], @Check[type:engineering-lore|dc:22|name:Load Ammo]{Engineering Lore}, @Check[type:thievery|dc:22|name:Load Ammo]):</strong> The crew must swivel the firing platform (which can rotate the cannon 360 degrees) and return the cannon to a neutral position so they can load a shell from the ammo hatch.

Alternatively, if the party can score just one direct hit on the approaching Gargantuan hill giant, the horde immediately breaks and flees.

It was originally built atop an ancient Nexian mage’s tower in 4608 ar, and these days it supplies many key buildings throughout Alkenstar with electricity.

Below ground, the Hydroforge provides an even more important service: purifying drinking water from the Ustradi River for the citizens of Alkenstar.</p>\n<p>A week ago, under orders from Loveless, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06parsus00000000]{Parsus} marched a zombie horde across the bottom of the river at night and captured the Hydroforge. Loveless claims that she’s planning to detonate the pyronite inside this building, but in reality she and Ibrium plan to betray Parsus. They will instead detonate the pyronite aboard a boat outside the Hydroforge, destroying the building and killing the necromancer inside. For their part, Parsus has also been preparing to betray Loveless and Ibrium. They quickly killed the engineers and technicians of the facility and used their corpses to explore the creation of undead-mechanical hybrids. The Hydroforge is isolated and receives few visitors; so far only a handful of people have noticed that the facility workers are missing. These cases all fell under the purview of Loveless’s cronies, who quickly buried the investigations. To supplement the slain engineers, Parsus’s minions also abducted nearly a hundred additional victims over the past week, mainly from among Alkenstar’s poorest and most vulnerable residents. Having thus created a small army of undead, Parsus’s plan is very simple: when Loveless lands with the pyronite, the necromancer’s undead army will overwhelm her and Ibrium. Parsus will then set timers on the bombs to destroy the falls and flee the area, leaving no one alive knowing that they were ever involved. </p>\n<p>Parsus has already created a host of undead monstrosities to inhabit the upper levels of the Hydroforge.

Deputy Loveless also has a remote detonator that she can\n  use to trigger all three bombs as a last resort.

Regional variants exist, but golem is usually played with three to six players and a dealer.</p>\n        <p><strong>Supplies:</strong> A deck of cards, plus a token to represent an amulet. A golem deck is identical to a real-world poker deck, except the cards go from 1 to 13 (no face cards) in four suits: flesh (hearts), clay (spades), stone (diamonds), and iron (clubs).</p>\n        <p><strong>How to Play:</strong> Golem is a card game similar to five-card draw poker (including the ranking of hands) in which players try to build the best hand. However, in addition to beating the other players, players must try to beat a “golem hand” to win the pot.</p>\n        <p>Golem is played in a series of games; one game must be completely resolved before the next begins. The player to the right of the dealer gets the amulet to start the night, and each player must ante by placing an amount (determined by the table, typically ranging anywhere between 2 cp and 5 gp) into the pot.</p>\n        <p>The dealer deals five cards to each player. Starting at the amulet, each player can take one of four actions:</p>\n        <ul>\n        <li>Bet (usually an amount at least equal to the ante; some casinos limit how high the original bet can go).</li>\n        <li>Match the current bet.</li>\n        <li>Raise the current bet (again, usually by an amount at least equal to the ante; sometimes with a limit).</li>\n        <li>Fold.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Anyone who folds is out of the game and can't come back in until a new game begins. The betting continues going around until all players have matched the current bet or folded.</p>\n        <p>Next, each player still in the game can discard up to two cards and receive that many back from the dealer. The discarded cards go face-down on the table's center. Another round of betting occurs, starting at the amulet.</p>\n        <p>If, at any point, only one player hasn't folded, that player wins the pot with the house taking 5 percent, and the game ends. If at least two players are still in the game after all bets are matched, those players reveal their hands. The dealer then “frees the golem.”</p>\n        <p>The golem hand—the best five-card hand created from the players' discarded cards—is revealed, and if the player with the best hand beats the golem, they win the pot, and the game is over. But if the player with the best hand doesn't beat the golem hand, that player must add an amount of coins to the pot (usually an amount equal to twice the ante), and all cards are collected so that a new hand can be dealt for the players who were still in the game. This continues until someone wins the pot. The house takes 5 percent of the final pot, the amulet moves one position counterclockwise at the table, and a new game is dealt.</p>\n      </section>\nAlternatively, characters could win one or more hands by succeeding at a @Check[type:games-lore|dc:25|name:Low Stakes Table]{Games Lore} or @Check[type:stealth|dc:25|name:Low Stakes Table] check. Similarly, a character who succeeds at a @Check[type:thievery|dc:25|name:Low Stakes Table] check can palm enough cards to win a hand by cheating. The DC for these checks ranges from 25 (playing at a low-stakes table) to 29 (playing against seasoned gamblers for high stakes @Check[type:games-lore|dc:25|name:High Stakes Table]{Games Lore} @Check[type:stealth|dc:25|name:High Stakes Table] @Check[type:thievery|dc:25|name:High Stakes Table]). The minimum bid at any table is 1 gp, but high rollers sometimes bid as high as 100 gp per hand. Of course, a character who wins too often will quickly find themselves without any takers left to gamble against. <p></p>\n<p>Characters who win a hand or two tend to loosen tongues as people warm up to new winners at the table, allowing them to acquire one or more rumors.</p>\n<p><strong>Ask the Crew:</strong> Roughly 40 crew members constantly bustle around the ship, seeing to the needs of every guest. A character who succeeds at a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:27] or @Check[type:intimidation|dc:27] check can talk to a crew member long enough to learn a rumor or two. The crew members also know the layout of the ship, making them a good source of information for navigating.</p>\n<p>Characters who fail several checks to talk with a crew member (or critically fail a single check) cause the sailor to become suspicious and report the characters.

Even on the upper\n    deck, it still stands atop the elevator platform, meaning the characters can\n    lower the elephant back into this room using the elevator controls. As the\n    characters likely discovered during the unveiling, Ibrium elected to hide\n    his pyronite bomb within the clockwork elephant to keep it safe from\n    tampering. The clockwork key to disable this bomb is located with Alethsia\n    in area\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18003bloodi.JournalEntryPage.03granddiningr00]{F23}.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The elephant was programmed to put on a display and continues to make poses\n    even after it’s lowered to this area. Characters who inspect the clockwork\n    beast discover a large hatch on the elephant’s back, which can be unlocked\n    to allow access to the pyronite bomb inside the construct. As soon as\n    someone other than Ibrium or Alethsia touches the glass hatch however, the\n    elephant goes berserk and attacks. As long as the glass elephant is\n    attacking, opening the hatch to disable the bomb isn’t easy. To attempt to\n    open the hatch, characters must ride the elephant’s back during combat. This\n    requires a successful\n    @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:27|traits:action:balance|name:Balance] check to\n    @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.M76ycLAqHoAgbcej]{Balance} or\n    @Check[type:athletics|dc:27|traits:action:climb|name:Climb] check to\n    @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.pprgrYQ1QnIDGZiy]{Climb} each round or they’ll\n    be thrown from the beast.

This is also a tricky proposition though, considering the\n    volatility of the explosive contained in the glass sculpture.

Rolling a successful attack in this way allows a character to\n    damage the clockwork creature safely. If the characters choose to attack\n    normally and roll a critical miss (or if they use another ability that might\n    penetrate the elephant’s chest), their attack strikes the clockwork bomb\n    inside the elephant and causes it to arm. In this case, the party has only a\n    few moments (5 rounds, possibly more at your discretion) to destroy the\n    elephant and disable the bomb (or perhaps push it overboard) before it\n    explodes and destroys the <i>Gearsmoke</i>.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<p><strong>Treasure:</strong> @Actor[OCcORtguEEiPbEwZ]{Elevator Floor}</p>\n<p>\n  A bag of glassblowing tools rests on the floor near the elevator, left behind\n  and forgotten by Alethsia.

It’s on the high end of a severe-threat encounter for\n      10th-level characters, so the party will almost certainly need to stick\n      together to survive. If one or more characters abandon the fight to pursue\n      the runaway bomb, consider having one or two of the enemies from this room\n      pursue them to ensure the characters who remain in this room aren’t\n      totally overwhelmed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A lot of this final encounter hinges on the assumption that Ibrium\n      activates his teleportation ritual as soon as the characters enter the\n      area. If your players have taken great efforts to hide their efforts from\n      the adventure’s villains or found some way to get the jump on Ibrium and\n      Loveless, this uninterruptible scene might seem farfetched or outright\n      unfair. In this case, you can modify the encounter so Ibrium instead\n      completes the ritual in the midst of combat; to do so, he must spend 2\n      actions to Cast a Spell, and the characters might be able to interrupt\n      this spell.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When in doubt, err on the side of your players. Simply put, if the people\n      at your table would have more fun disrupting Loveless and Ibrium’s scheme\n      before it has even the slightest chance of success—and their characters\n      make all the right moves to accomplish this feat—then you’re likely better\n      off playing out that scene rather than forcing a potentially frustrating\n      climactic scene. (Of course, it’s highly unlikely the characters don’t\n      bungle at least part of their mission on the <i>Gearsmoke</i>, in which\n      case you shouldn’t be afraid to say “Bombs away!” and run the encounter as\n      written.)\n    </p>\n  </aside>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Final Countdown:</strong> By now, Loveless and Ibrium know their\n    plan is close to failure, so they trigger their last contingency. Just as\n    the characters enter this area, several things happen all at once, starting\n    with Ibrium activating his teleportation ritual, which instantly transports\n    the entire boat to the precipice of the Alken Falls. The sudden\n    teleportation causes catastrophic damage to the ship, rupturing the hull in\n    several places and throwing the boat off kilter.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Off-Kilter Boat:</strong> Once Ibrium enacts his ritual, the entire\n    boat is teleported to a rocky outcropping just on the edge of the Alken\n    Falls, now directly under the middle of the ship’s hull. For the next 10\n    rounds, the boat slowly rocks back and forth as it reaches equilibrium atop\n    the rock. At the beginning of the first round of combat, before any creature\n    can act, the boat tilts toward the bow. Each creature standing on the deck\n    of the <i>Gearsmoke</i> must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:27] or\n    @Check[type:reflex|dc:27] save (creature’s choice) or stumble 10 feet toward\n    the bow of the boat and become\n    @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} until the\n    start of the next round; on a critical failure, the creature also falls\n    @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}. At the start of\n    the next round, the boat tilts toward the stern, triggering the same process\n    in reverse. The boat continues to rock this way for 10 rounds or until the\n    pyronite bomb detonates, whichever happens first.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Runaway Bomb:</strong> At the beginning of the first round of\n    combat, before any creature can act and after Ibrium has enacted his ritual,\n    a hole ruptures open in the floor of this room, causing the bomb to fall\n    through to the hallway outside area\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18003bloodi.JournalEntryPage.03servantsquar00]{F22}\n    as the ship tilts toward the bow.

Each success earns the party 1 Chase Point, whereas a critical success awards 2 Chase Points.

For example, for the first obstacle, Rocking Boat, once the party accrues 4 Chase Points, they progress to the next obstacle; it might take only two characters to overcome the obstacle (if they both roll critical successes), in which case the remaining characters in the party can proceed to roll checks for the next obstacle.

With this last task accomplished, Dunsmith then elects to retire to a small ranch outside the city to raise and breed mutant cattle. Now that the powerful criminal organizations headed by Loveless and Mugland are both dismantled, Vivielle Ramslay fills the power vacuum, becoming one of the largest power brokers in the Alkenstar underworld. </p>\n<p>Of course, the most significant consequence of the campaign hinges on the fate of Gattlebee’s pyronite formula, which had fallen into the hands of Loveless, Ibrium, Parsus, Mugland, and Kosowana (and perhaps others) over the course of the campaign. Ricia has many other agents, so it’s possible that, if the characters apprehended all the major villains with access to the formula, the grand duchess’s forces were able to capture all the remaining criminals who knew the formula as well. In this case, the pyronite formula remains a secret—at least for a while. This puts the characters in the enviable but dangerous position of being the only actors at large with access to the formula. Eventually, a mysterious (and inhuman) broker calling himself Mr. Gallows approaches them with an offer to sell the formula. He takes the characters to a private auction attended by representatives from nations such as Nex, Geb, Katapesh, and Cheliax. Potent artifacts, deeds to gem mines, keys to private demiplanes, and even more outlandish offers are all on the table for the characters. Will they maintain their allegiance to Ricia and Alkenstar or play the bidders against one another for the highest offer?</p>\n<p>It’s more likely, however, that the secret for pyronite does escape out into the world, either during the campaign or shortly after. In this case, the first two powers to adopt the pyronite for military use are Nex, which develops units of flying apes capable of bombarding enemies with pyronite from the sky; and Geb, which create legions of quickened zombie sappers strapped with pyronite to devastate enemy fortifications. Luckily, as Ricia predicted, the relatively even disbursement of the formula means that the nations maintain an uneasy stalemate, since no one side is eager to provoke the others into an all-out war. Soon, the secret of pyronite spreads farther afield to Qadira, Osirion, and Absalom, changing the world forever.</p>\n<p>The new demand for pyronite creates a sudden rush to the Spellscar Desert, which contains deposits of the special white salt required to stabilize the potent explosive, a salt found nowhere else in Golarion. Overnight, a horde of adventurers and prospectors flock to the region to harvest the salt and sell it to alchemists in distant lands for a massive profit. Bidding wars erupt over guides and gunslingers from Alkenstar who know how to navigate the strange wasteland and find salt deposits. The greatest beneficiaries of this sudden salt rush are the mutant denizens of the Spellscar Desert, who intimately know its terrain and ultimately decide who may enter and who may leave their unpredictable home territory. The incredible wealth flocking to the region allows formerly small mutant war bands to purchase powerful weaponry, expand their ranks, and unify into powerful forces. In time, as mutant leaders battle for supremacy, a new nation might be born within the Spellscar Desert, its coffers filled by ever growing demand for pyronite salt. </p>"},"More Adventures in Alkenstar":{"name":"More Adventures in Alkenstar","text":"<p>Following the events of the campaign, the characters have a number of new avenues of adventure.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">The Blood Lord’s Revenge</h2>\n<p>Upon @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06parsus00000000]{Parsus's} defeat, word of the matter eventually reaches their vampiric father, Drakar Fademore (NE male vampire overlord 14). Drakar bears only a distant love for Parsus, but he nonetheless ventures to Alkenstar to seek vengeance as a matter of honor. The vampire and his six children, along with their pack of vampiric yeth hounds, establish a lair in a Ferrous Quarter slaughterhouse from which they can torment all those involved in Parsus’s death or other downfall.</p>\n<p>Drakar begins his campaign of terror by leaving a talking severed head at the gates of Alkenstar Castle to deliver a dire message: during tomorrow’s first night of the full moon, Drakar’s hunt will begin—starting with Grand Duchess Ricia. In response, Ricia gathers her most powerful servants (including the characters) and fortifies the castle. But Drakar and his minions possess innate abilities that make them nearly impossible to detect or track. The blood lord and his children slip into the castle and begin a wild hunt through the fortress halls, forcing the characters to move Ricia from room to room and battle Parsus’s lesser siblings.</p>\n<p>By the end of the night, Ricia (hopefully) still lives, but Drakar and several of Parsus’s surviving siblings have escaped. In order to capture the vampires running amok in her city, Ricia proposes releasing Parsus from prison (or raising them from the dead). Once returned to action, Parsus is more than willing to help locate and exact revenge on their father, although likely via unorthodox and possibly grisly methods. Eventually, with Parsus’s help, the characters can track Drakar to his slaughterhouse domain and slay the wicked vampire and his damned entourage.</p>\n<p>Although this brings an end to Parsus’s dhampir siblings, Drakar himself is not so easily dispatched. Parsus explains that their father removed his withered heart centuries ago and hid it somewhere within the Fademore estate. To kill the blood lord for good, the party must journey to Geb and assault the haunted ancestral home. Inside a cursed hedge maze in the center of the grounds, the characters locate a blood-weeping tree guarded by the ghosts of every Nexian wizard Drakar has ever killed. Deep inside the tree, the vampire’s heart still beats, waiting for the characters to drive a stake through it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">The Book of Nex</h2>\n<p>After vanquishing @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06ibrium00000000]{Ibrium}, the characters discover a missive from a mysterious benefactor among his things. According to the missive, the benefactor sent Ibrium an enormous sum of money as part of the next stage in their grand plot. This fortune of cold, hard cash, along with details on how it should be used, now sits in Ibrium’s personal vault in the town of Martel.</p>\n<p>Of course, the grand duchy has officially sealed the vault until further notice, so the characters must stage a daring heist into the supposedly impervious “twinned treasury.” The two buildings’ security systems are inextricably intertwined: to unlock the doors or disable the traps in one building, the counterpart trap or door in the other building must be undone at the same time. Thus, to reach the bottom of the treasury and access Ibrium’s vault, the party must infiltrate both sides of the structure at once. </p>\n<p>Accomplishing this feat requires at least eight heist members to activate all the various timed locks in unison, meaning the characters will need to assemble a crack team of cat burglars to execute their scheme. Luckily the party has a wealth of Alkenstar contacts to draw from, including Phera Wyndslow, Vivielle Ramslay, and others, though convincing everyone to take part in such a risky endeavor might not be easy.</p>\n<p>After infiltrating the facility, disabling deadly traps, and battling clockwork guardians, the characters at last breach Ibrium’s vault. Inside, they find a pile of gold and also learn that Ibrium’s benefactor is an Arclord of Nex named Kiamal, who possesses some of Nex’s original writings detailing methods for teleporting huge objects. It was Kiamal who taught Ibrium how to teleport the Gearsmoke using latent magic from the Mana Wastes, and it seems that her plan this whole time was merely to use the ship as an initial test. In anticipation of this test’s success, she provided Ibrium with construction diagrams (not yet knowing of his failure) for building vast teleportation stabilizers within Alkenstar. If her theories are correct, these stabilizers would be capable of transporting the entire city across the face of Golarion. </p>\n<p>No doubt troubled by these plans and perhaps at the behest of Ricia, the characters must journey to Quantium to confront Kiamal. The Arclord lives within a flying tower that randomly teleports throughout the city and leaves uninvited guests floating in thin air. To access the tower, the characters will need to ingratiate themselves with Kiamal’s monstrous associates, including a sphinx named Apitesh and a calikang noble named Uluoshko, who each possess magical tokens allowing them to safely visit the tower. Inside the tower, the characters battle Kiamal’s many teleporting minions before confronting Kiamal herself—only to discover that their foe is a mere simulacrum.</p>\n<p>The real Kiamal teleported to the Mana Wastes shortly after Ibrium’s demise. For years, she has delved ever deeper into Nex’s book of magic, mastering potent teleportation spells. Giddy with power, she intends to transport all of Alkenstar to the outskirts of Quantium, combining the two cities (and eventually all the other major cities of Golarion) into one grand, chimeric metropolis. To save Alkenstar, the party must race through the city and dismantle her half-finished teleportation stabilizers—all the while battling extraplanar and alien creatures magically transported into the city from every side of the cosmos—before finally defeating the evil Arclord. </p>"},"What if the Party Fails?":{"name":"What if the Party Fails?","text":"<p>It’s possible that the characters fail to stop @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18006advent.JournalEntryPage.06anjeliquelov00]{Loveless's} plan, particularly if she triggers her bombs on the Gearsmoke before the party can defuse them.

Loveless plans to wield this force against both Nex and Geb in a bid for power over eastern Garund.</p>\n<p>To reverse their undead conditions, the characters must brave Alkenstar’s most conflict-torn districts. In the anarchic Ironside Quarter, they find unusual allies in the form of like-minded outcasts and leaders of the rebellion.

By enlisting the aid of geniuses from around Alkenstar, the underdogs amass a force of clockwork warriors to combat Loveless’s legion of murderous shieldmarshals. Loveless herself is fortified within a massive rolling castle powered by clockwork gears, from which she commands an ever-widening swath of wasteland around Alkenstar. The castle is equipped with mighty cannons and protected by deadly pyronite golems whose lobbed ammunition can quickly reduce enemy fortifications to rubble.

Behind their protection stand three large towers as well as the Gunworks’ proudest achievement: a massive cannon known as the Maw of Rovagug, which looms atop the castle like the horn of a mighty beast.</p>\n<p>The acrid scent of gunpowder lingers over the fortress, spread through the wastes by a near-constant breeze that wafts from Lake Ustradi. During the day, the courtyard hums with the haggling of artificers and the whinnying of horses, punctuated frequently by resounding booms. Newcomers often dive for cover during the first explosion of the morning, while local residents barely look up from their tasks, accustomed as they are to the deafening crescendos that emanate from the Gunworks’ testing chambers. </p>\n<p>After a brief flurry of bartering in the Artificers’ Market at dusk, blessed quiet falls over the castle at nightfall. Behind the protection of the keep’s wall, engineers and inventors scribe their latest innovations to parchment by lantern light, while adventurers and card sharks carouse late into the evening at the Last Stop Saloon. Meanwhile, stoic shieldmarshals stand watch atop the walls, eyes and ears alert for any encroaching raiders or mutated beasts. Occasionally, the booming of ominous drums echoes across the lake from deep within the Western Ravage—a grim reminder that past the walls of the Gunworks, the comforts of the city come to an abrupt and violent end. </p>"},"History":{"name":"History","text":"<p>War bands have battled for dominance along the rocky outcropping upon which the Gunworks is built since the beginning of Nex and Geb’s ancient war millennia ago. A strategic mound on the shore of Lake Ustradi, the site provides an unparalleled view of the surrounding region. When the city of Alkenstar was founded, Ancil Alkenstar knew river trade would be key to his fledgling nation’s survival and growth. He devoted substantial resources to securing the Ustradi River, which at the time was ruled by dozens of petty kings, each vying to maintain absolute control over their section of the water. One by one, Ancil defeated each of these would-be rulers until he reached a fortress atop a prominent rocky outcropping near Lake Ustradi. After driving out the violent berserkers inhabiting the wooden fortress, Alkenstar’s commanders left behind a strong garrison of shieldmarshals to protect the spot, which has remained in the hands of the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar ever since. </p>\n<p>Construction of the Gunworks, as it’s known today, was completed in 4620 ar. With the might of Alkenstar growing, Ancil recognized the shieldmarshal’s demand for more, deadlier firearms was quickly outstripping the city’s ability to manufacture them. He also knew the best alchemical and metallurgical experiments were usually the most dangerous, and permitting such work to be conducted within the city’s walls was folly. He ordered the wooden fortress near Lake Ustradi leveled and raised a new fortification in its place. This castle would have three functions: a bastion against giant raiders from the west, a manufactory where firearms could be produced at a rapid pace, and a research and development facility for new types of dangerous technology. </p>\n<p>When it was finished at last, the Gunworks swiftly filled with brilliant young minds from the city seeking to work on innovative science. Over the decades, they outfitted the shieldmarshals with powerful firearms and ever-greater siege bombards. Eventually, they developed a massive mobile cannon, greater than any the world had seen. They boasted that its fearsome size alone could inspire opponents to lay down their arms in surrender, thus winning battles without ever firing a shot. This theory was put to the test in 4684 ar, when the Gorilla King of Usaro led a surprise attack against Alkenstar. His army invaded Alkenstar’s hinterlands via hidden tunnels beneath the Shattered Range. The Gunworks’ bombard was wheeled to the field of battle, but when the invaders refused to retreat and it came time to ignite the cannon, the weapon misfired. The gorilla hordes quickly overran the cannon’s position, slaughtered the artillerists there, and hauled the cannon away as a prize for their simian lord.</p>\n<p>The forces of the Gorilla King were eventually repulsed. Although the Gunworks stood unconquered, the pride of Alkenstar was tarnished. But the citizens of the Gunworks were used to sudden turns of fortune, and they weren’t disheartened for long. They began building a new, even more fearsome bombard with renewed vigor. Though somewhat smaller than their previous effort and lacking its mobility, this latest weapon had a far greater range and was thoroughly tested. Because the new cannon was effective at a distance of nearly 50 miles, the engineers could construct it within the walls of the Gunworks, ensuring it would not easily fall into enemy hands. They dubbed their devastating new weapon the Maw of Rovagug. </p>\n<p>In 4699 ar, new troubles began brewing in the Western Ravage. After a successful raid on the docks of the Gunworks, a mutated giant calling himself Lord Gorge united several war bands from the wastes. Dubbing them his “Slugs of the Wastes” (as poetic a phrase as the warmonger could muster), Lord Gorge quickly set about organizing the monstrous hordes into a fierce guerilla force to torment Alkenstar. The hordes engaged in regular raids along the Ustradi River. By hurling boulders and triggering landslides, the giants sank or blockaded dozens of river boats and rafts bearing firearm-laden cargo from the Gunworks.</p>\n<p>River traffic slowed to a crawl. For three years, the Gunworks relied upon “gun runs” to deliver new firearms to Alkenstar—madcap sprints in which grim shieldmarshals steered heavily armored stagecoaches pulled by clockwork steeds. Usually, such gun runs were successful. Occasionally, the runs ended in tragedy as marauding giants intercepted carriages, slaughtered the crew, and made off with the goods. Lord Gorge ordered any captured stagecoaches to be retrofitted for his ogre minions. Soon, berserkers astride spike-covered war wagons chased shieldmarshals across the desert, practically eliminating the viability of gun runs.</p>\n<p>One summer, a band of daring shieldmarshals ranged deep into the Western Ravage and located Lord Gorge’s war camp. At the cost of many lives, they relayed the camp’s coordinates to the Gunworks. Once the coordinates were received, a single blast from the Maw of Rovagug obliterated the camp and Lord Gorge along with it. Without their leader, the might of the united war bands was shattered at last. </p>\n<p>The returning shieldmarshals were hailed as heroes and formed into a new special unit called the Ravage Raiders. These elite commandos were charged with patrolling the Mana Wastes to ensure no Slug war bands ever united again. However, some whisper rumors that a new power is emerging along the Western Ravage. Supposedly, one of Lord Gorge’s daughters survived the blast that killed her father and is looking for a way to continue Gorge’s bloody legacy. Harnessing the rogue magic of the Spellscar Desert, she purposefully mutates her giant servants so they can breathe underwater, burrow underground, and, in some cases, fly. If her efforts are allowed to continue, “Lordess Gorge” will soon have a force of mutated raiders far surpassing the original Slugs of the Wastes.</p>"},"Notable Personalities":{"name":"Notable Personalities","text":"<p>The Gunworks is filled with a strange blend of personalities, ranging from eccentric intellectuals who pursue knowledge for its own sake to leathery roughnecks whose gruff and ruthless personalities make them well-suited to guarding the remote outpost.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Della Sangrey</h2>\n<p>Della Sangrey is the head metallurgist of the Tower of Metallurgy.

Although he finds the longstanding rivalry between the Tower of Engineering and the Tower of Metallurgy a tad childish, he nevertheless finds himself frequently at odds with Della Sangrey. Erdrik has a fascination with the ancient golems and constructs of the Spellscar Desert. Every year, he takes a monthlong sabbatical and leads a group of hired adventurers into the bizarre wasteland to excavate mechanical wonders from the hard-packed soil. </p>\n<p>Erdrik was raised by a rock gnome named Olteo, who taught Erdrik everything he knew about metalworking and artisanship. Deeply passionate about his work, Erdrik saves his highest respect for other engineers and artisans. According to the customary bylaws of the Tower of Engineering, Erdrik is bound to meet with any visitor to the tower who requests an audience. After several months of particularly annoying petitioners seeking his engineering expertise, Erdrik had a complex mechanical door installed in his office—part vault door and part puzzle. Visitors are still welcome to visit Erdrik any time they please, provided they can figure out how to open his door.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Goltor Baird</h2>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_goltorBaird.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_goltorBaird.webp')\" />\n<p>The current leader of the Ravage Raiders is Goltor Baird, a half-giant ranger with decades of wasteland experience. Goltor grew up among the Slugs of the Wastes and served under Lord Gorge during his reign of terror. The course of her life changed when a band of shieldmarshals, led by a young Loy Ayton, cornered and slaughtered Goltor’s war band. Loy sensed something unusual in Goltor and ultimately decided to spare the young ranger’s life. She joined the Ravage Raiders soon after and has served them loyally ever since. </p>\n<p>Goltor assumed command of the Ravage Raiders four years ago after a mutated blue dragon with eight eyes and spider-like pincers ate her predecessor. She still hunts for the dragon, named Y’maxxinara, to this day. </p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Loy Ayton</h2>\n<p>Loy Ayton is the Gunworks’ garrison commander. Although he’s ostensibly in charge of the entire fortress, Loy usually allows Della Sangrey and Erdrik Marth to run their towers with little intervention. Now in his later years, he’s a surprisingly laconic man whose typical leadership style is to let non-fatal matters work themselves out. Ayton runs things by the book and is usually content to follow all the necessary bureaucratic protocols, even if they take unreasonably long. Once his mind is made up, however, he is quick to act and unbending in his convictions. </p>\n<p>Although one could scarcely guess it by his easy manner, Loy is a battle-hardened gunslinger who has served in countless dangerous missions throughout the wastelands. He has an uncanny eye for talent and for solving multiple problems simultaneously, especially when it comes to trading favors with visiting adventurers.</p>"},"The Thunder Fair":{"name":"The Thunder Fair","text":"<p>Every year during the height of summer, pavilions are erected, dozens of boats dock along the riverside, and the wealthy elite of Alkenstar arrive to see the latest wonders manufactured by the minds of the Gunworks. This festival, called the Thunder Fair, is the main battleground in the intense rivalry between the Tower of Metallurgy and the Tower of Engineering.</p>\n<p>The Thunder Fair’s most spectacular and hotly anticipated competition is called the Bombard Battle. In the days before the fair, the towers set up boulders (and sometimes statues) at intervals in the desert beyond the Gunworks’ walls. The factions then compete to see who can demolish the boulders most effectively and at the greatest range, while spectators watch from a safe distance with spyglasses. The Bombard Battle keeps adventurers in demand year-round at the Gunworks, as each tower constantly work to secure rare reagents for testing their latest engines of destruction. Most years, the grand duchess or her most trusted bureaucrats personally attend the Bombard Battle, making note of promising inventions that should receive grants from the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar.</p>\n<p>Past Thunder Fairs were plagued by attacks from mutated @Compendium[pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.n1jTYFRCaqF1nQrf]{Titan Centipede} (burrow speed of 50 feet instead of climb speed). These beasts seem attracted to the explosions that pulverize the desert sands during the festival. To keep the centipede numbers down, the garrison commander annually honors the bravest and most cunning badlands rangers with the position of wastehunter. Each wastehunter leads a hunting party that scours the desert for miles around the citadel. The hunts almost always encounter at least a few centipedes, and the battles are fierce and deadly, but the result is a safe Thunder Fair. By the end of the month, up to half a dozen titan centipede heads are mounted above the gates of the Gunworks where they remain as grisly trophies for the duration of the Thunder Fair.</p>\n<p>Another unique Thunder Fair attraction is blast lancing. Blast lancing bouts are essentially jousting tournaments, except the jousters ride clockwork steeds and carry special weapons called @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.qLhb5ZvIDOmbwvc9]{Blast Lances}. The blast lance delivers a powerful blast upon striking an opponent, occasionally throwing a rider up to a dozen feet from their mount. To mitigate the fatal nature of blast lancing contests (severe injuries and death are common occurrences), wealthy contestants often enter clockwork jousters into the competition in their stead. Nowadays, roughly half the jousters in blast lancing bouts are constructs. Of course, young and foolhardy aristocrats eagerly compete each year, and many do so with the protection of specially reinforced plate armor. The winner of last year’s blast lancing tournament was a mysterious figure whose name on the tourney bracket was Sable Clockwork. The stoic competitor appeared in a suit of full plate mail festooned with gears and powered by clockwork windings. The figure spoke no words during the entire tournament and bested each challenger with unmatched skill. None can say for sure whether Sable Clockwork was a construct or actually a living person hidden beneath the suit of armor. Sable Clockwork is the talk of the upcoming Thunder Fair, and all hope for the enigmatic jouster’s return. </p>\n<p>This year, special foreign security measures are underway; according to rumors, a group of powerful thieves calling themselves the Wraith Council is planning a heist at the upcoming Thunder Fair. The thieves are rumored to be remnants of distant Westcrown’s defunct but legendary Council of Thieves. When Cheliax caught wind of the rumors, the country sent a contingent of Hellknights from the Order of the Gate to the Gunworks to apprehend the rogues. The Hellknights are led by Signifer Dolazzan, who claims to have special knowledge of the Wraith Council and has asked shieldmarshals to aid Cheliax in preventing the upcoming heist. So far, Dolazzan’s entreaties have been rudely rebuffed. Many at the Gunworks speculate about the Order of the Gate’s arrival, since this branch of Hellknights is known to specialize in conjuring and summoning outsiders. The order’s presence in Alkenstar could indicate a potential extraplanar threat, though Dolazzan has remained tight-lipped on the matter until he secures local aid.</p>"},"Locations":{"name":"Locations","text":"<p>The following locations correspond to the map of the Gunworks. </p>"},"1 Stockyard":{"name":"1 Stockyard","text":"<h2 class=\"no-toc\">1.

Since raiders are a constant danger, the herd is typically moved within the fortress walls at night and kept within this fenced area. During the day, they are let out to graze on the dry grasses surrounding the keep under the watchful eye of Clif Warken, the head cattle hand. </p>\n<p>Several times per year, Clif is provided with a large stipend to purchase new cattle for the Gunworks. For the past several years running, instead of buying normal cattle, he’s purchased stolen cattle from cattle rustlers for half the price and pocketed the difference. He has yet to be caught, further emboldening him to experiment with smuggling illicit goods into the fortress at night along with the herd. </p>"},"2 Last Stop Saloon":{"name":"2 Last Stop Saloon","text":"<h2 class=\"no-toc\">2. Last Stop Saloon</h2>\n<p>This large saloon is the last watering hole for adventurers headed from Alkenstar to the Western Ravage. The saloon is frequented by a wide variety of gunslingers, card sharks, and deadly mercenaries in addition to off-duty shieldmarshals. Due to the local presence the Ravage Raiders, many of whom are half-ogre or half-giant, roughly a third of the furniture and lodgings in the saloon are sized for Large creatures. A wide porch runs around the entire saloon, from which gunslingers lounging in rocking chairs size up the Gunworks’ newest arrivals.</p>\n<p>The proprietor of the inn is a retired one-eyed ranger called Hatchet. No one knows Hatchet’s real name, despite much speculation by saloon regulars. Hatchet remains tightlipped on the issue. Some say he is merely stoic, while others say Hatchet has a troubled past and built the Last Stop Saloon to lay low on the edge of civilization.</p>\n<p>The saloon gets rowdy during afternoons and evenings. A popular drinking game involves ordering a round of shots every time the patrons hear a boom outside (which is often, due to the constant testing of explosives and black powder in the Gunworks). Years ago, an adventuring band returned to the saloon with the skull of a half-giant skald from a Slug war band. During mana storms, this skull—now mounted on the wall over the bar—takes on a life of its own and sings guttural battle ballads. Regulars know the words to these songs by now, but newcomers often gawk in horror.</p>"},"3 Tower of Metallurgy":{"name":"3 Tower of Metallurgy","text":"<h2 class=\"no-toc\">3.

The tower’s rank-and-file researchers live in dormitories on the upper floors, while the lower levels house labs with workbenches covered in pipes and beakers and vials used for testing chemical compounds—an area the metallurgists call the Glassworks. Under the ground floor is the Hall of Crucibles, a cavernous chamber dominated by two enormous crucibles used to smelt new alloys and a dozen smaller crucibles for test batches. </p>\n<p>Further down, in a hallway known only to Della and a few of the tower’s oldest metallurgists, is a locked adamantine door. Years ago, an experiment developing a self-repairing alloy ran awry, and the newly created metal began growing through the labs of the tower, slowly consuming everything in its path. Attempts to destroy the metal proved fruitless, so the metallurgists sealed away the infected portion of the tower with an adamantine door, which has remained closed ever since. Not even Della knows what lies on the other side or what has become of the all-consuming metal in the years since it was isolated from the rest of the tower.</p>"},"4 Tower of Engineering":{"name":"4 Tower of Engineering","text":"<h2 class=\"no-toc\">4.

The ground floor, a hangar filled with the largest weapons of war currently under development, is known as the Hall of Siegecraft.</p>\n<p>On the roof of the tower, visible from the plains outside the Gunworks, is an incredibly complex machine of winding gears and intricate mechanisms that the engineers affectionately named the Machine Ponderous. A small diamond rotates inside the heart of the fiendishly complex machine. To gain admission to the Tower of Engineering, applicants must retrieve the diamond without disrupting the device.

Most of the Gunworks’ engineers and metallurgists long ago lost interest in the rote construction of mass-produced firearms, so they constructed this building, which serves as a clockwork assembly line. Only a handful of technicians are required to ensure the assembly line’s smooth operation, allowing most of the Gunworks’ occupants to focus their attentions on more interesting projects and experiments. A mana storm recently swept over the Gunworks and, unbeknownst to anyone, bestowed a mysterious sentience upon the network of clockwork machines within the Manufactory.

Many of Alkenstar’s greenest, most adventurous shieldmarshals specifically request a post at the Gunworks in the hopes of seeing action in the Western Ravage. To counteract the spirited nature of his inexperienced garrison, Loy runs operations with militaristic precision and ensures new recruits are too exhausted to even think of starting trouble for trouble’s sake.

The interior of the tower is filled with clockwork elevators that lift the cannon’s massive ammunition rounds from storage to the roof. The cannon is capable of protecting the walls of Alkenstar up to a range of nearly 50 miles. Firing such great distances requires careful planning, calculation, and patience to avoid wasting both time and pricey ammunition. To ensure their strikes land true, the Gunworks sends outriders to scout wasteland targets and relay information back to the Gunworks to calibrate the giant gun’s angle and direction. Specially trained hawks and other animals often relay messages between outriders and the Gunworks to avoid either side having to rely on spells or magic items, which can be risky during mana storms.</p>"},"9 Artificers’ Market":{"name":"9 Artificers’ Market","text":"<h2 class=\"no-toc\">9.

In reality, the city’s bureaucrats long ago gave up trying to shut down this gray market, as prohibition only drove the sales underground. Alkenstar politicians feign ignorance of the Artificers’ Market as long as Gunworks inhabitants agree to sell their goods only to citizens of Alkenstar and not foreigners.</p>\n<p>Adventurers heading into the Western Ravage often stop at the market to purchase weapons and armor.

The docks supply the fortress with material from Alkenstar via boat along the Ustradi River. To discourage raiders, shieldmarshals greet every newly arriving ship and help unload cargo to get it inside the fortress as fast as possible. The docks have been burned and rebuilt dozens of times over the years. Some claim bricked-over rooms and buried sublevels exist within the structures, sealed away and long forgotten.</p>\n<p>Although it has the capacity to produce many firearms, the Gunworks has long kept production levels artificially low. This has always rankled the minds of some of the Gunworks’ most ardent creators, who prefer to produce a wide variety of weapons for experimentation and testing. For centuries, many of these artificers circumvented production-limiting mandates by dumping excess weaponry into Lake Ustradi, which is quite deep even just a few dozen yards from the docks.

The doors now stand open from dawn to dusk each day and the garrison commander pays a bounty to adventurers willing to venture into the caves and return with maps of the tunnels. Initial forays revealed tortuous tunnels and extensive caverns. The upper caves are said to be inhabited by roaming colonies of mobile fungi, unusual insects, and—if the wilder rumors are to be believed—bands of mutant humanoids with mole-like features.

These minions shuffle forth with the mindless motions of the unliving and are little more than puppets under your control. Similarly, via careful tinkering and anatomical study, you learned how to make a powerful necromechanical ally. Finally, your technological prowess is such that you can use your innovations to force even powerful, free-willed undead to obey you.</p>\n<p>The secret to your success is a combination of alchemy and clockwork, machines and magic, science and spellcasting. Of course, crafting the shell of a wind-up zombie is one matter—your primary focus is on the craftwork necessary to make the whole thing work together. To you, the magic involved is only a means to an end, a way to make science more efficient through necromancy and potentially a little bit of evocation for some electric power.</p>\n<p>While some think your creations are vile, you see beauty in utility and believe animated corpses are tools that can be used for good or ill. For better or worse, when it comes to results, the science you’ve cobbled together fulfills the most important criterium for any new innovation: it works, plain and simple. Your reanimated clockwork corpses are stable, effective, and, more importantly, they don’t rampage or crave the flesh of the living in the same way an undead would. Plus, they aren’t vulnerable to positive energy, making them easier to use around good clerics and their ilk without your minions taking friendly fire. (Except Pharasmins, always so inconveniently up in arms about the whole “desecrating the bodies of the dead” thing.

Both escaped from the conflict gravely injured, and after that day the two became mortal enemies hellbent on undoing the work of the other. After years of conflict, Gris eventually concocted a devious plan to bring Entarish to his knees. In the ruins of flooded temple beneath a hunter’s moon, Gris gave birth to a changling infant and left the child on Entarish’s doorstep. Gris knew that foolish Entarish, in his weakness, would care for the cursed babe.</p>\n<p>Even though he suspected Gris was tied to the child, Entarish played into the hag’s plot. He named the infant Anjelique and served as her father and mentor, raising her to follow a virtuous path in spite of her wretched heritage. Yet for all Entarish’s noble efforts, Anjelique possessed a cruel disposition and wicked temper. When she came of age, Gris approached the young woman in the dead of night and revealed the truth of her birth. Gris then commanded Anjelique to kill her adopted father and join the hag’s side.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_Anjelique_Loveless.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_Anjelique_Loveless.webp')\" />\n<p>To Gris’s surprise, Anjelique refused her mother’s grim commandment. In a rage, Gris gathered her most powerful minions and finally slew Entarish, overwhelming the paladin while Anjelique was away. When she discovered her father had been slain, Anjelique recovered his holy sword and set out to find Gris. The cunning hag thought Anjelique had finally given in to her evil birthright and returned home, but instead she avenged her fallen parent by soaking his sword in Gris’s blood and claiming the hag’s blackwood staff.</p>\n<p>After fulfilling her vendetta, Anjelique wandered through the world alone, aimless and in search of meaning. Although she constantly carries Entarish’s virtuous words in her thoughts, her troubled past and cursed birthright cast an unholy pall across her mind.</p>\n<p>Finally Anjelique resolved to walk a righteous path in the name of her father by joining Alkenstar’s shieldmarshals. She commissioned the grand duchy’s best gunsmith to forge Entarish’s blade into an enchanted silver pistol and Gris’s staff into a magical long gun. For nearly a century, Anjelique brought law and order to the wilderness around Alkenstar. The long years wore on her, however, and she slowly lost touch with the short-lived humans that surrounded her. Now, she’s torn between upholding lawful ideals and dealing out bloody punishment to those she deems unworthy. Her silver pistol still possesses some of Entarish’s grace and frequently misfires when she attempts to use it for an evil act. Often, while away from prying eyes, she will draw the pistol on her captured fugitives and fire, allowing the gun to decide if the person is worthy of life.</p>\n<p>Anjelique’s primary motivation is power. As an elf, she’s been a shieldmarshal for nearly a century and has outlived her original peers. Because of her lengthy tenure and ruthless pursuit of her own personal brand of justice, few question her continued presence on the force. Anjelique has spent years advocating for a larger Alkenstari army, though she made little progress on this front until just recently. She believes that by arranging a series of disasters, she can shock the city’s political elite into action. By way of this scheme, Anjelique hopes to disgrace the current shieldmarshal command structure while simultaneously rising through the ranks to assume control of a new army of conscripted shieldmarshals. Ultimately, she wants to use this army to bring order to the lawless frontier beyond Alkenstar’s walls, which she believes is what Entarish would have wanted.</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h1>\n<p>Deputy Loveless has been a thorn in the player characters’ sides since the first chapter of this Adventure Path, and possibly even before then.

His mother, Tolliya, was a powerful mage who played a large role in the political machinations of the Council of Three and Nine, but Ibrium never showed much interest in politics. Instead, his interests lay firmly in the arcane, and in his youth he showed all the signs of a gifted wizard-to-be. Tolliya ensured her son had access to the best education possible, hiring private tutors from across the Inner Sea and conjuring eldritch creatures from distant planes to advise the young spellcaster. When Ibrium at last came of age, Tolliya gifted him a precious heirloom of their house—a wizard’s staff topped with a basilisk eye.</p>\n<p>The gift turned out to be a formative one as it sparked Ibrium’s interest in petrification and, soon after, a lifelong study of spells related to earth and fire. The promising young wizard developed his own personal form of magic, vitrumancy, specializing in the conjuration and transmutation of glass.</p>\n<p>Ibrium’s passion for glass and petrification magic caused him to cross paths with a variety of colorful individuals. One such character was a young medusa named Alethsia, who’d journeyed to Quantium in the hopes of finding a magical way to remove her unusual curse—a petrifying gaze that turned her victims not to stone, but statues of solid glass.</p>\n<p>Ashamed of her cursed gaze, Alethsia was an artist at heart who hoped to someday live among humans and pursue her sculpture work in peace. Ibrium heard rumors of the unusual glassy-gazed medusa through some contacts and tracked her down. He was instantly smitten. He convinced her that her gaze wasn’t a curse but a gift, and together they used her unique “talent” to destroy Ibrium’s mother’s political enemies. Ever since that day, the two have been steadfast lovers. Wherever she goes, Alethsia brings along a host of glass statues (her previous victims), which she sculpts and modifies to “perfect” their beauty. From time to time, she becomes frustrated with her work and smashes them into glass powder, which Ibrium then transforms into sand sentries.</p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_Ibrium.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_Ibrium.webp')\" />\n<p>Several years ago, Ibrium’s mother was assassinated in the midst of a power struggle in Quantium, leaving Ibrium as the sole heir to their estate. He quickly invested the bulk of his fortune in an ill-advised scheme to magically transform vast swathes of Nexian wasteland into arable farmland. The investment proved a disaster and Ibrium was financially ruined. During this dark hour, a mysterious Arclord of Nex named Kiamal approached the vitrumancer. She offered to provide a sizable loan to Ibrium in exchange for his services in Alkenstar. A new war between Nex and Geb was inevitable, Kiamal explained, and those with financial interests in Alkenstar would profit greatly once the conflict was ignited. In exchange for travelling to the city and finding a way to profit from the inevitable war, Kiamal promised Ibrium a lavish sum in Nexian gold.</p>\n<p>Ibrium was quick to accept the offer, even if Kiamal’s motives didn’t ring true. Why would the Arclord, whose wealth seemed bottomless, need to further fill her coffers through schemes in Alkenstar? Ibrium was too desperate to labor over such questions, so he simply embarked for the City of Smog with Alethsia in tow. When they arrived in the new city, Ibrium quickly fell in with prominent politicians and warmongering nobles who also believed a Geb-Nex conflict was imminent. Amid these grim social circles, he met Deputy Anjelique Loveless and Parsus. After Ibrium wrote to Kiamal describing Anjelique’s plan to demolish Alken Falls, Kiamal provided Ibrium with an arcane ritual, supposedly transcribed from the books of Nex himself, which would allow the wizard to teleport the bomb-laden Gearsmoke directly to the waterfall at the city’s center.</p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h1>\n<p>Despite his haughty demeanor and role as one of the chief antagonists for this adventure, at the end of the day Ibrium is mostly a pawn in a great game being played by far more powerful entities. On one hand, he serves his mysterious patron Kiamal, who seems to have her own inscrutable plans for Alkenstar, while on the other he allows Anjelique to dictate their plans to demolish Alken Falls. If Ibrium survives the adventure, he likely discovers both his employers couldn’t be trusted—Anjelique planned to have him killed via poison, and Kiamal washes her hands clean of Ibrium as soon as she receives word of his catastrophic failure. Deeper in debt than ever and with no allies left, Ibrium could prove a useful tool for the PCs, perhaps giving them information on his patron or revealing the location of her vault in Martel.</p>\n<p>Ibrium is an arrogant man who, despite living a life of extreme privilege, believes he has earned everything that’s come his way and that he deserves only the best. He’s a pathological liar and narcissist who sincerely doesn’t recall any of his many failures or shortcomings. Ibrium’s role in Anjelique’s plan doesn’t become clear until this adventure, but he’s lived in the city of Alkenstar for nearly two years now and is known for displaying his obnoxious wealth (which is secretly funded by Kiamal).</p>\n<p>At your discretion, the party might meet Ibrium earlier in the campaign—perhaps as a guest at a high-class establishment like the Steaming Kingdom, or just as a passerby on the streets who splatters mud on the characters as he zooms past on a luxurious litter borne aloft by glass clockwork servants.

Parsus and their six older siblings are all dhampirs, half-vampire progeny born from a vampire and mortal union. Their father is Drakar Fademore, a powerful vampire and Blood Lord of Geb—one of 60 undead leaders who oversee the dread empire’s unholy administration.</p>\n<p>From an early age, Father Fademore taught his brood to revile magic users, and he instilled in the children an unquenchable thirst for arcanists’ blood. Under the patriarch’s guidance, Parsus and their siblings participated in “blood hunts.” On such occasions, the family would gather a host of vampiric yeth hounds and chase spellcasting victims through the woods for days at a time. Unlike their elder siblings, Parsus possessed little skill with martial arts and enjoyed neither combat nor hunting. Instead, their passions drew them to study magic and science. Parsus’s father looked on these pursuits with disdain, viewing them as paltry hobbies that paled in comparison to the honor, glory, and bloodshed of a spirited hunt. The Fademore family had earned its status through bloodshed during Geb’s great war with Nex, specializing in hunting and killing the wizards of Quantium. Instead of learning to hunt wizards, like a true Fademore, Parsus was interested in becoming one. </p>\n<img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_Parsus.webp\" alt=\" \" style=\"shape-outside:url('modules/pf2e-ap180-the-smoking-gun/assets/art/PZO90180_Parsus.webp')\" />\n<p>After letting Parsus’s obsession grow for years, Drakar eventually decided to draw them into the family hunts by force. He took Parsus deep into the Axan Woods and left them there, telling them to live or die as they wish, but not to return home without a fresh kill. Rather than giving into their feral instincts, Parsus instead studied the stars to navigate their way home and developed a magical snare to kill a forest dryad. They returned home triumphant, believing they proved the value of knowledge over instinct. Drakar, however, was displeased. </p>\n<p>For the next decade, Drakar’s tests and challenges for Parsus grew ever more brutal. Through it all, Parsus refused to abandon their love of knowledge and magic. Each test only served to further strengthen their resolve and honed their skills until, one day, Parsus discovered they had become a potent necromancer. Parsus’s siblings had meanwhile become master hunters and earned their father’s favor, while Parsus was ultimately cast aside and forgotten. In time, their craving for approval turned into deep hatred for the entire Fademore family.</p>\n<p>Several years ago, Drakar turned over finances of the Fademore estate to Rhyst, Parsus’s eldest sister. Ever the pragmatist, Rhyst quickly decided to save her father from any further embarrassment and sent Parsus away from the estate. If a new war between Nex and Geb were to break out, the city of Alkenstar to the north would be a ripe ground for investment, Rhyst explained to a seething Parsus. The necromancer had no choice but to board a Gebbite barge pulled by massive skeletal crocodiles (fruits of their own childhood projects) and set out for Alkenstar. Once in the city, they half-heartedly looked for ways their family might profit from war, but primarily focused on studying the city’s fascinating clockwork wonders. Eventually, a shieldmarshal named Anjelique discovered Parsus and decided the promising spellcaster could help her further her own violent schemes. </p>\n<h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h1>\n<p>Although they were ordered to Alkenstar to find a way to profit from a war between Nex and Geb, Parsus has little interest in money and mainly thirsts for knowledge. More than anything, Parsus’s true enemies are their family, particularly their father Drakar and eldest sister Rhyst. They dream of revenge daily and, though they would never admit it, below this hatred, some part of Parsus still yearns for acceptance from their family. </p>\n<p>Though a vile individual with disturbing sensibilities, the true Parsus is little more than a pawn in Anjelique and Ibrium’s grand plan. Parsus was primarily following orders when they took over the Tinwound Hydroplant and slaughtered its caretakers, and the necromancer stoically explains as much when the player characters apprehend them in the factory’s blood-soaked engine room. If Parsus survives the adventure, they hold no particular grudge against the characters, sensing a kinship with them, as they are themselves, after all, only following orders. Regardless, Parsus has no wish to confront Anjelique or Ibrium, recognizing the duo has thoroughly outplayed them. The only way to convinced Parsus to aid the characters’ pursuits is by ensuring that doing so would mean snubbing Parsus’s most hated adversary, their father Drakar.</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc
