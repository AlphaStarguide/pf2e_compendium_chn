Few\n    foreigners hold the undead nation or its melancholic ghost king with anything other than distaste, but they’ve\n    come to rely on Geb’s cheap, zombie-raised food. That reliance puts these nations at a significant risk when\n    the ghost king’s scheming right-hand vampire looks to sacrifice thousands for his personal power.\n  </p>\n  <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap181-zombie-feast/assets/art/PZO90181_CHANCELLOR_KEMNEBI.webp\" alt=\"Vampire with a sardonic smile and determined eyes\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap181-zombie-feast/assets/art/PZO90181_CHANCELLOR_KEMNEBI.webp')\">\n  <p>\n    Geb, the infamous necromancer, founded the nation millennia ago. After his earth-scorching war with the archmage Nex\n    ground to a halt, Geb found no passion for ruling and no meaning without his rivalry, so he ended his life, but\n    arose as a ghost. No more interested in rulership as a ghost than he had as a living man, Geb mostly retreated from\n    public view and entrusted control of the country to his 60 apprentices, the Blood Lords.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Blood Lords swiftly secured an iron grip on the nation. They leveraged Geb’s rival economic factions to\n    cement this control, playing the factions off each other and maneuvering Geb’s people and assets like pawns in\n    a great game. Fearing old age and refusing to share power, many Blood Lords transformed themselves into undead. Some\n    of today’s Blood Lords are the same scheming necromancers who originally served Geb while he lived. Chief\n    among them is Chancellor Kemnebi, Geb’s principal advisor. Kemnebi is a psychic vampire called a vetalarana\n    with a plan to sacrifice the nation to advance his personal ambitions.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Kemnebi’s Plan</h1>\n  <p>Geb has recently become more active, shaken from his melancholy by rumors that his old rival Nex might</p>\n  <p>\n    soon return to the world. He began gearing up his nation for war, which demands maintaining its role as an economic\n    powerhouse—and that means keeping good relations with its trade partners. Kemnebi has conflicting plans.\n    He’s perfecting a poison to kill tens of thousands in neighboring nations and render the corpses susceptible\n    to mass animation by Kemnebi.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Kemnebi’s special poison has three parts: two alchemical and one magical. The alchemical parts are braingrit\n    and tremor paste. Individually, these components aren’t poisonous; they only combine into poison when\n    consumed. They also have no significant taste or smell, making the poison nearly impossible to detect, and can be\n    slipped into food in great quantities very easily. But just poisoning people isn’t enough—a third,\n    magical ingredient called shadow ash makes the poisoned corpses easy to animate with the right manipulation of\n    necromantic energy: energy that Kemnebi alone knows. Although Kemnebi has the first two ingredients well in-hand at\n    the start of the Blood Lords Adventure Path (in fact, the characters uncover a test of the poison components in the\n    first adventure), the magical ingredient poses him some difficulty. By the Adventure Path’s fifth volume,\n    Kemnebi has discovered the secret to creating shadow ash: a captive and tortured phoenix-like creature infused with\n    shadow magic, destroyed again and again to produce limitless quantities of shadow ash.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Should his plans come to fruitition, Kemnebi will be able to murder Geb’s neighbors and create legions of\n    shadow-fueled undead subservient him alone, all in one fell swoop. Kemnebi is counting on Geb’s ennui and\n    indolence to distract him, but the chancellor hasn’t counted on a group of up-and-coming Blood Lords\n    uncovering his scheme.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Languages</h1>\n  <p>\n    The assumption of a common language is useful in any campaign, but the specific setting might determine which\n    language is in common use. Throughout the Blood Lords Adventure Path, references to the “Common”\n    language (such as in creature stat blocks) refer to Osiriani, rather than Taldane. All player characters have\n    Osiriani as their default common language; they can pick up Taldane if they’d like. Necril, the language of\n    the undead, is prevalent in Geb, so all characters also have access to Necril as a language.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Timeline</h1>\n  <p>Key events leading up to the start of the Blood Lords Adventure Path are listed below.</p>\n  <table>\n    <tbody><tr>\n      <th>Date</th>\n      <th>Event</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>–929 AR</td>\n      <td>\n        The declining empire of Osirion formally cedes control of its southern reaches to the archmages Geb\n        and Nex.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>–892 AR</td>\n      <td>Nex and Geb go to war, unleashing dire magic against each other’s nations.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>576 AR</td>\n      <td>\n        Nex magically destroys many Gebbites, prompting Geb to resurrect a vast undead army and march on Nex.

Investigating some recent disruptions, the characters discover that\n  a gang called the Three-Fingered Hand is trying to slip subtle poisons into Graydirge’s food supplies. Once the\n  characters defeat @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18107toolbo.JournalEntryPage.07kepgedatheha00]{Kepgeda the Hag-Nailed}, the changeling necromancer leading the gang, they learn that the\n  Three-Fingered Hand works for a coven of hags called the Graveclaw.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Graveclaw</h2>\n<p>\n  This adventure puts the characters on the hunt for the hag coven called the Graveclaw, whose members are scattered\n  across the nation. The characters must vanquish an annis hag named Iron Taviah in the Axan Wood, a sea hag in a\n  flooded coastal town, a rust hag in a depopulated city of metalworkers, and a grave hag at a necromantic school near\n  the metropolis of Yled. They learn the greater plot isn’t just to poison the living, but to raise the slain more\n  easily as undead.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Field of Maidens</h2>\n<p>\n  The characters learn that Iron Taviah has risen as a vampire and is fleeing south across Geb. The disfavored spymaster\n  Seldeg Bhedlis thinks she might be traveling to meet up with a superior in the plot to poison Geb’s neighbors,\n  so he commissions the characters to track her down. Iron Taviah enters the Field of Maidens to reach Kemnebi’s\n  former manor, Gristlehall, but the characters end up between two competing factions from Holomog. The characters\n  discover that Kemnebi is behind the poisoning plot, but they lack proof.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">The Ghouls Hunger</h2>\n<p>The characters need to find out more about Kemnebi’s plans, and that means going to the capital city of</p>\n<p>\n  Mechitar. An audience with Geb takes a surprising turn when he appoints them as the newest Blood Lords and assigns\n  them to escort a powerful visitor from the Darklands, Kortash Khain. The characters must fend off the intrigues of\n  rival Blood Lords, fulfill Kortash’s goals during his visit, and subtly pursue their investigations into\n  Kemnebi.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">A Taste of Ashes</h2>\n<p>\n  The characters venture to the temple to Urgathoa in Yled, as this place seems to be the source of the magical shadow\n  ash. The characters uncover a smuggling ring within the church and find a shae ally who can point them to proof of\n  Kemnebi’s involvement—if they can survive a high-class play in one of Yled’s strangest playhouses.\n  In the hidden tunnels and chambers beneath the city, the characters discover the source of the shadow ash, but they\n  must confront ageless guardians instrumental to Yled’s defenses.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"no-toc\">Ghost King’s Rage</h2>\n<p>\n  With proof that Kemnebi is behind the crop poisoning and the attack on Geb’s trading partners, the characters\n  meet with the ghost king himself. He wants Kemnebi not only stopped but destroyed, and he wants the characters to\n  deliver the killing blow. The characters marshal the support of the Great Factions from whom they’ve earned\n  favor in the Adventure Path thus far and penetrate Kemnebi’s hidden sanctum.

Eventually, they’ll have an opportunity to become Blood Lords themselves. In “Zombie\n      Feast,” Berline Haldoli of the Reanimators is the only Blood Lord with whom the player characters interact.\n      While they may have grand aspirations about future careers as Blood Lords, no one in Graydirge is likely to treat\n      them with any amount of deference until they begin to prove their worth.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Each volume of this Adventure Path calls out specific points when player characters can take actions or make\n      decisions that affect their “Faction Reputation.” More details on how the player characters can earn\n      favor—and disfavor—with Geb’s Great Factions can be found in the Factions of Geb article, which\n      includes a tracking sheet for Reputation Points. Berline Haldoli is not only the player characters’ patron,\n      but also their only official connection to the Great Factions—specifically, the Reanimators. Whether the\n      player characters decide to strengthen this relationship or turn their attention to other Great Factions is up to\n      them.\n    </p>\n  </aside>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc contents\">Chapter 1: A Taste of Treachery</h2>\n  <p>\n    Berline the Reanimator, a minor Blood Lord responsible for the zombie-worked farms in the hinterlands of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18105graydi.JournalEntryPage.05graydirge00000]{Graydirge},\n    sends the player characters to investigate a nearby farm where several zombie animals broke loose and are running\n    rampant. She offers the deed to an abandoned manor outside Graydirge as payment for setting the farm in working\n    order, but the characters must clear the manor of dangerous creatures before it can function as their new base of\n    operations.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc contents\">Chapter 2: Marrow and Mystery</h2>\n  <p>\n    After the player characters make some suspicious discoveries at Berline’s farm and their new manor, they dine\n    with devout worshippers of Zon-Kuthon, the god of pain. These priests have information that helps the player\n    characters connect a mysterious corpse they found in the manor’s basement with a defunct bank, and more leads\n    suggest the trouble on the farm might be related to the Bone Shards, a pathetic local gang. Following these leads,\n    the player characters discover hints of a broader conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <h2 class=\"no-toc contents\">Chapter 3: Spoiled Rotten</h2>\n  <p>\n    All signs point to the Three-Fingered Hand, an up-and-coming local gang, as the culprit behind the recent sabotage,\n    killings, and thefts. To learn more about this gang’s ruthless leader and her motivations, as well as her\n    connection to a coven of hags with sinister plots across Geb, the player characters must infiltrate the brewery that\n    serves as a front for the gang’s&nbsp;activities.\n  </p>\n  <section class=\"advancement-track\">\n    <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Advancement Track</h1>\n    <p>“Zombie Feast” is designed for four characters.</p>\n    <p><span class=\"level\">1</span> The characters begin this adventure at 1st level.</p>\n    <p><span class=\"level\">2</span> The characters should reach 2nd level once they’ve cleared out their new manor.</p>\n    <p><span class=\"level\">3</span> The characters should reach 3rd level after exploring the Bone Shards hideout and Graydirge Bank.</p>\n    <p><span class=\"level\">4</span> The characters should reach 4th level by the time they complete the adventure.</p>\n  </section>\n\n"

She sends\n      them to one of the many farms under her management to learn why the farm’s zombie animals are running amok\n      and to return the farm to working order. As a reward, she offers the deed to a manor on the outskirts of\n      Graydirge. While setting things right at the farm, the characters discover signs of battle and sabotage, but they\n      lack the information necessary to follow up on these events. Satisfied with their work, Berline gives them the\n      deed, but the characters need to clear their new manor of dangers before they can move in.\n    </p>\n    <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Chapter 1 Treasure</h1>\n    <p>The permanent and consumable items available as treasure in Chapter 1 are as follows.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><em>+1 hatchet</em></li>\n      <li><em>+1 scythe</em></li>\n      <li><em>everburning torch</em></li>\n      <li>full plate</li>\n      <li>ghost ink (<em>Pathfinder Advanced Player’s Guide</em> 255)</li>\n      <li>lesser antiplague</li>\n      <li>lesser focus cathartic (<em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em> 253)</li>\n      <li>\n        <em>minor oil of unlife</em> (<em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>\n        258)\n      </li>\n      <li>silversheen</li>\n      <li>\n        <em>walking cauldron</em> (<em>Advanced Player’s Guide</em>\n        264)\n      </li>\n      <li><em>wondrous figurine, onyx dog</em></li>\n    </ul>\n  </aside>\n  <p>\n    Geb’s neighbors in the Impossible Lands and other nations across the Inner Sea may express disgust at the\n    zombie workforce running most of Geb’s farms, but there is no doubt as to the efficiency of its agriculture.\n    Few can compete with the prices of Geb’s cheap, zombie-raised food, and many have come to rely on it. As part\n    of Chancellor Kemnebi’s plot to poison Geb’s food supply and create an army from the dead, the vampire\n    selected the ossuary-city of @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18105graydi.JournalEntryPage.05graydirge00000]{Graydirge} as a test target for two of the poison’s components. As isolated\n    ingredients, brain grit and tremor paste are not poisonous; when combined and consumed, they become lethal. Kemnebi\n    suspects the mass death that would result from poisoning the food supplies of Graydirge—a city in Geb’s\n    heartland with a delectable number of living residents—would be impossible to trace to Kemnebi’s\n    operatives. Blood Lords would point fingers at one another or blame the living for being weak, and the Celebrants\n    would find a way to write off the genocide as some sort of demonstration of Geb’s power. The nation would move\n    on. If the poisoning proved successful, Kemnebi would be one step further in his sinister plan.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Kemnebi uses a gang called the Three-Fingered Hand to operate in Graydirge, feeding information through enough\n    intermediaries to shield him from being implicated. The gang’s leader,\n    <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18107toolbo.JournalEntryPage.07kepgedatheha00]{Kepgeda the Hag-Nailed}</strong> (NE female changeling human necromancer 5), is the daughter of an annis hag\n    in a powerful coven called the Graveclaw. This poisoning is Kepgeda’s opportunity to show her mother she can\n    be trusted with greater things, and it starts with poisoning a single farm to show the ingredients’ efficacy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Kepgeda sent a few gang members to poison Old Ergagh’s Farm a few miles outside Graydirge. The gang members\n    knew that their vile deed was intended to cause mass suffering and death, and that they’d cause a lot of\n    trouble for their boss if they were noticed. When the farm’s chargehands discovered gang members poisoning the\n    grain silos, the gang attacked, hoping to cover their tracks. In the ensuing chaos, many of the farm’s zombies\n    broke from the chargehands’ control. All the gang members perished while thoroughly bungling the\n    job—which is lucky for them, as Kepgeda is not known for her patience with failure.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    With the chargehands dead or taking shelter to avoid the unleashed zombies, Old Ergagh’s Farm ceased shipping\n    food to Graydirge.\n    <strong>Berline Haldoli</strong> (LE female halfling necromancer 6), a Blood Lord affiliated with the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06reanimators000]{Reanimators}\n    faction, oversees Graydirge’s zombie-run farms. She immediately noticed when a farm missed a shipment—a\n    rare occurrence, given the level of organization and strict scheduling she demands of her subordinates. Always on\n    the lookout for opportunities to bring up-and-coming individuals under her wing in the endless scheming of\n    Geb’s undead rulers, Berline called on some of her acquaintances—the player characters—to help set\n    Old Ergagh’s Farm back in working order. She has no idea that evidence at the farm points to a vile plot\n    orchestrated by the person at the hub of Geb’s circle of powerful Blood Lords.\n  </p>\n\n"

As the player characters\n    approach the archway that serves as the main entrance, a finely dressed ghoul ushers them into the villa’s\n    sprawling grounds. This is Majordomo <strong>Mhyurk</strong> (LE male ghoul butler 2), who bares his gleaming teeth\n    in a welcoming smile as he leads the characters through the orderly yard. He bids them pay no heed to the dozen or\n    so workers busily tilling the gardens, pushing wheelbarrows, and hauling heavy loads; their rigid movements and\n    rotting flesh reveal that these workers are mindless zombies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The villa’s primary residence is a large house built in a more modern style, with ribs, skulls, and femurs\n    accentuating the predominantly brick construction. A few outbuildings—storage sheds, workers’ homes, and\n    the like—also surround the courtyard. As the player characters approach the residence with Mhyurk, a nearby\n    zombie stops dead in its tracks, slowly turning its head in their direction.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"read-aloud\">\n    As the zombie turns, it gnashes its teeth and lets out a low, drawn-out moan from deep in its torn throat. The sharp\n    creak of a door cuts off the rasping noise. A halfling of medium height and middle age stands on the villa’s\n    front porch. She wears a yellow dress with ruffles, an orange cloak with the hood thrown back to show her\n    brownish-red, curly hair, and necklace of grisly charms. She holds a gnarled black staff topped with a pig’s\n    skull, which she taps on the porch’s wooden rail to keep the zombie’s attention as she takes a few\n    barefoot steps in its direction.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The woman is Berline Haldoli, and she quickly calls out in a peppy voice for “Glorinsa” as she keeps the\n    zombie’s attention focused on her. A young human woman in plain but well-kept servants’ clothes comes\n    running, her eyes wide at the sight of the zombie.\n    <strong>Glorinsa</strong> (LE female human corpse tender 2) gives a quick bow and apologizes, first to\n    “Mistress Haldoli,” then to Mhyurk and the player characters. She draws the zombie’s attention\n    with gentle snaps of her fingers and makes soothing noises as she leads it back toward the gardens to work.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Berline waits at the top of the porch steps. Mhyurk gives a sheepish grin, mutters something about how long it takes\n    to train good corpse tenders, and gestures for the player characters to enter the residence. Berline greets each of\n    them in turn, welcoming them like old friends, and asks them to wait in the dining room while she finishes preparing\n    their meal.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The dining room is just beyond a small entryway. Tiny, colorful bone tiles in intricate patterns decorate most of\n    the walls and floor. Much of the furniture is made of a mix of wood and polished bones. Most of the rooms are\n    designed with comfort in mind: Long, cushioned benches line many walls, and plentiful cushions, rugs, and blankets\n    surround numerous low tables. Other passages lead to adjoining rooms, but Berline requests the player characters to\n    remain in the dining room for now; a few servants are busy cleaning, which means they need to keep their attention\n    focused on the zombies they’re commanding to do the labor. She smiles as she opines that distractions can lead\n    to inconvenient messes in a corpse tender’s work.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Once the player characters gather in Berline’s dining room, she serves up a delicious feast. The main course\n    is a sweet-and-savory chicken, egg, and almond pie. She also serves bowls of steamed grains with caramelized onions,\n    raisins, and stewed vegetables; a tomato-and-cucumber salad; a hearty stew of lamb, carrots, and potatoes; and a\n    basket filled with loaves of crusty bread. Berline insists on the characters enjoying a hearty meal with her before\n    discussing serious business. She has a variety of offerings for individuals with other appetites as well—this\n    is Geb, after all. She&nbsp;bounces around the dining area and makes trips to the kitchen to grab forgotten\n    utensils, happily fetching whatever blood or other grim sustenance a character requires with no less enthusiasm than\n    she shows for mundane food.\n  </p>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n    <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Starting at the Farm</h1>\n    <p>\n      Some groups might want to begin the adventure in medias res, that is, in the middle of things. You could begin the\n      adventure with the player characters approaching Old Ergagh’s Farm, or truly throw them into the thick of\n      things by having them start in the stomping grounds (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02stompinggrou00]{A4}) being chased around by Mosghuta,\n      the boss cow. Careful! She’s deadly. When the characters manage to regain control of the situation (most\n      likely by escaping from the creature, or possibly by capturing or destroying it), you can provide their mission\n      briefing from Berline or play out the scene at her villa as a flashback. Then, the player characters can continue\n      their investigation of the farm.\n    </p>\n  </aside>\n  <p>\n    During the meal, Berline insists the player characters make brief introductions if any of them have not met one\n    another. Each of them likely has an extant established relationship with Berline, but she is happy to remind them of\n    her important work with the Reanimators and her status as the only ruling Blood Lord operating from Graydirge. Most\n    of the other Blood Lords spend their time in Mechitar, a place far too busy for Berline’s liking. From what\n    she knows of them, Berline is certain the player characters are going to make a name for themselves in Geb, and\n    she’s interested in having them as allies. Thus, she treats them well despite her higher social position.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Berline is polite and pleasant when interacting with her servants throughout dinner; these servants include Mhyurk\n    the butler, a number of living halflings and humans, and a lanky skeleton named Reacher who helps fetch things on\n    high shelves. Berline’s staff goes about their duties with seeming cheer, though any character who succeeds on\n    a @Check[type:perception|dc:12|traits:action:sense-motive,secret|name:Sense motive] check to @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive} discerns that they’re all utterly terrified of her. If a character\n    comments on her servants’ fear, Berline asks in a deadpan voice whether the character fears her as well. She\n    waits a long moment before bursting out in shrill laughter and ladling up more food.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When Berline is ready to give the player characters their assignment, she gestures for her servants to clear the\n    table. Three servants and four disembodied, fleshy hands come forward. The hands pass the cutlery along, dumping it\n    all tidily into a large basket, while the humanoid servants gather larger items. As they work, Berline speaks. Read\n    or paraphrase the following.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"read-aloud\">\n    <p>\n      “Thank you all for joining me today. I trust you enjoyed the meal? If not, we can always turn you into a\n      zombie. They’re far less picky, right? Very low maintenance. Well, that’s not entirely correct, which\n      I suppose is the reason I’ve gathered you all here.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “I am a necromancer by trade, and I am also a Blood Lord, so I’m basically a necromancer with lots of\n      paperwork, responsibilities, and competition. As I’m also closely affiliated with the Reanimators—one\n      of the Great Factions—I am responsible for raising and maintaining the undead labor force that operates\n      Graydirge’s farms. We grow lots of food in Geb, not just for Gebbites, but for trade across the Inner Sea.\n      I’m talking about actual people food. I mean, food for living people, not food that is living people.\n      That’s not my specific business.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Zombie farmers are my business. The zombies don’t run the farms; they just work the farms under the\n      direction of my chargehands. It’s a difficult and dangerous line of work, but it’s possible to turn\n      most zombies into relatively docile creatures with the right techniques. The chargehands keep the working zombies\n      from shambling this way and that. Most of the chargehands are zombies themselves, in fact, but ones that have\n      retained their personalities and memories. They do good work.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “However, in the last few days, I learned of some trouble at one of the farms that supplies food for the\n      people of Graydirge itself: Old Ergagh’s Farm. It’s built on the foundations of an old stone dwelling\n      of some kind, possibly as old as Graydirge itself. Well, the farm missed a few shipments. I sent some workers to\n      investigate, but they couldn’t get too close—there were zombies roaming everywhere. I can’t\n      imagine any of the chargehands abandoning their duties, much less all of them, so I suspect foul play.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “That’s where you come in. I want you to go to Old Ergagh’s Farm and put the place back in\n      working order. From the sound of it, the zombies caused a fair bit of damage: broken enclosures, doors wrenched\n      from hinges, crops trampled, chargehands slain... Fix what you can, recover any food that’s worth eating,\n      and make sure the zombies can’t do any more damage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “Most importantly, I’d like you to find out what happened and report back. You should seek out\n      Brahdek—he’s in charge. He’s the only living member of the workforce, and he’s a distant\n      cousin of mine. You’ll know him by his bare feet and red hair. If he’s not there, look around and see\n      what you can find out.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “As payment, I’ll sign over the deed to an abandoned manor just outside the city. It came into my\n      possession recently, and I can think of no better use for it than to reward my new friends for their\n      service!”\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar float-right\">\n    <h1 class=\"no-toc\">They’re Everywhere!</h1>\n    <p>\n      There are zombies of various kinds—humanoid shamblers, horses, dogs, and Mosghuta, the boss cow—in\n      areas\n      @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02maingate000000]{A1}, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02stompinggrou00]{A4}, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02occupiedbarn00]{A7}, and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02loadingyard000]{A9}, plus a few in area\n      @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02hearthchambe00]{A12} that are otherwise occupied. The mindless zombies have one response to any sort of intrusion\n      they sense on the farm: shamble in the general direction of the disturbance and kill anything that moves. Unless\n      the player characters take care to dispatch threats without making noise, the zombies in these areas may soon\n      converge upon the party. A large group of zombies poses a serious threat, especially if the boss cow gets too\n      close; Mosghuta has a good chance to score a critical hit and instantly kill a 1st-level character in a single\n      blow.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Some players will likely enjoy the challenge. Luring slow-moving zombies around the farm can work as a puzzle of\n      sorts, challenging the players to think on their feet and use clever tactics to avoid being overwhelmed. Zombies\n      aren’t subtle, and while there may be a jump-scare or two when the characters first encounter them, the\n      characters should have plenty of warning when more zombies are headed in their direction. If you think the\n      challenge is too great for your group, consider making the zombies a little less aware of their surroundings.\n    </p>\n  </aside>\n  <p>\n    The player characters might have questions for Berline, which she answers as best she can, but she doesn’t\n    know anything else about what happened or who might be responsible. She is happy to help and delights in chatting,\n    but if the characters dally too long, she cheerfully reminds them that zombies might last forever, but she\n    won’t. “Unless I change my mind about becoming a vampire,” she adds with a wink.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the player characters ask about how to deal with zombies, Berline reminds them that zombies are mindless. Their\n    behavior is predictable unless they’re under somebody’s direct control, and the problem is they’ve\n    broken that control. Berline requests the player characters leave the zombies alone if they’re not acting\n    aggressively; some of them might just be standing in the fields posing no problems, for example. If the characters\n    can avoid disturbing docile zombies, her chargehands can command the zombies later without trouble. Agitated zombies\n    need to be destroyed or contained. Either option is acceptable to Berline, as long as she can get back to farming.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the player characters ask about “Old Ergagh,” Berline grins. “I think Ergagh must have been a\n    hermit, quite some time ago. No one really knows. Old Ergagh is just a name written on the wall of the ancient\n    dwelling we built the farm on. Anyway, if you ever figure out who Old Ergagh was, I’ll give you a hand.”\n    She gestures to the crawling hand servants that are clearing the table. One of them pauses to make a rude gesture,\n    but Berline just giggles.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When the player characters are ready to depart, Berline provides directions to Old Ergagh’s Farm and bids them\n    farewell. With a grin and a “by the way,” she offers one final warning: Watch out for Mosghuta, a\n    massive and practically unkillable zombie boss cow that she raised herself to do the most strenuous labor on the\n    farm (and to fight off attackers, should the need arise). Berline suspects the characters may have to put Mosghuta\n    down if she’s broken from her chargehand’s control, but Berline begs them to keep their distance and\n    plan carefully. If Mosghuta’s on the loose, she is extraordinarily dangerous.\n  </p>\n\n"

Simple gardeners’\n    implements lie in a tidy arrangement at the south end of the stone slab.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    This is where Brahdek stored whatever he managed to grow in the garden outside, as the cool stone chamber functioned\n    as a serviceable cellar. The original purpose of the elevated stone slab is unclear, but it makes a good table and\n    work surface. Though food stored here would normally last several weeks or months, some wandering zombies brought\n    some filth in with them a few days ago, and rot took hold. The old writing chiseled into the west wall reads:\n    “Old Ergagh sups here, enjoying meals with friends and foes alike.” A character who can read the script\n    and succeeds at a @Check[type:occultism|dc:15|traits:action:decipher-writing,secret|name:Decipher Writing] or\n    @Check[type:society|dc:15|traits:action:decipher-writing,secret|name:Decipher Writing] check to\n    @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.d9gbpiQjChYDYA2L]{Decipher Writing} picks up on the context that Old Ergagh was a\n    cannibal.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Farm Restoration:</strong> A bit of the food, such as berries in sealed jaws and some seed potatoes in a\n    sack that avoided the rot can be salvaged with a successful\n    @Check[type:cooking-lore|dc:12|traits:action:recall-knowledge,secret|name:Recall Knowledge]{Cooking Lore} or\n    @Check[type:farming-lore|dc:12|traits:action:recall-knowledge,secret|name:Recall Knowledge]{Farming Lore} check, or\n    @Check[type:nature|dc:15|traits:action:recall-knowledge,secret|name:Recall Knowledge] check to Recall Knowledge.\n  </p>\n\n"

Zombies had ample time in the past several days to cause problems\n    merely by shambling around: they’ve trampled crops, broken bonds and barriers, and wrecked equipment in their\n    efforts to chase down the farm’s few living workers and any wild animals who strayed too close. Many areas\n    indicate specific efforts the player characters can take to set the farm in working order. Additionally, the player\n    characters can attempt the following tasks as exploration activities.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Evaluate Crops:</strong> The farm has a few fields beyond the boundary of the map. Low stone fences surround\n    them, and a few dozen @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.0plBflWwrCWQO2RO]{Zombie Shamblers} stand idly among the\n    crops. Still recovering from the effects of being so thoroughly under the control of the farm’s chargehands,\n    they are relatively docile and do not currently pose a threat to the player characters. However, they might pose a\n    risk to anyone surveying the fields for damage due to trampling or neglect. A character can identify crops that need\n    the most urgent attention with a successful @Check[type:nature|dc:15|name:Evaluate Crops] check, or they can take a\n    comprehensive survey of the fields with a successful @Check[type:stealth|dc:15|name:Evaluate Crop] check. A\n    character who critically fails either check disturbs the zombies, breaking them from their passive state. They begin\n    wandering around the fields in search of their next meal. The player characters can continue attempting to evaluate\n    crops, but any further failures or critical failures cause the zombies to roam too erratically to make further\n    attempts practical. As Berline specifically requested the player characters avoid killing docile zombies, they do\n    not earn any experience if they fight or destroy these creatures.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Repair Equipment:</strong> Beyond the damaged equipment described in the encounter areas, such as the ruined\n    zombie tack in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02zombietackbu00]{A2}, broken equipment is strewn across the farm. Much of it is\n    beyond repair, but some damage (such as bent wheels for wheelbarrows, snapped shovels and hoes, cracked buckets, and\n    torn seed bags) is reparable. A player character can attempt to salvage materials or repair equipment to help\n    restore the farm’s operation. A player character can accomplish this task by succeeding at a\n    @Check[type:crafting|dc:15|name:Repair Equipment] check, or a\n    @Check[type:farming-lore|dc:12|traits:action:recall-knowledge,secret|name:Recall Knowledge(Repair\n    Equipment)]{Farming Lore} check or another appropriate Lore skill.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Corral Loose Zombies: </strong>They may not be chargehands, but the player characters can attempt to corral\n    some of the zombies that strayed from the farm. A character can accomplish this task with a successful\n    @Check[type:religion|dc:15|name:Corral Loose Zombies] check or @Check[type:perception|dc:17|name:Corral Loose\n    Zombies] check to anticipate the creatures’ behavior, or a with a successful\n    @Check[type:athletics|dc:15|name:Corral Loose Zombies] or @Check[type:acrobatics|dc:15|name:Corral Loose Zombies]\n    check to outrun or outmaneuver them as they lure the zombies into appropriate enclosures. A character who critically\n    fails one of these checks is fatigued from the effort.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> You can award XP for fixing up the farm in two ways. You can either provide 10 XP for\n    each task the PCs successfully accomplish (such as fixing the door in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02emptyzombieb00]{A3},\n    resetting the trapped gate in area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18102ataste.JournalEntryPage.02westgate000000]{A11}, or performing a task listed above), to a\n    maximum of 80 XP. Alternatively, you can award 30 XP if the players give a token effort to fix up the farm, or award\n    them 80 XP if they make a big effort.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The player characters might devise clever ways to trap various hostile zombies, such as by barricading them inside\n    buildings. If they do, award them XP as if they had defeated the zombies in combat. Grant this award only for\n    creatures specifically called out as enemies in the farm’s encounter areas.\n  </p>\n\n"

She knows the previous owner was named Qhallaqh\n    the Collector, but she’s not exactly sure who he was, whether he was important, or what he collected.

The glass hardened long ago, but it emits an eerie,\n    blood-red glow when any light shines on it, including daylight or moonlight. This light is the result of careful\n    glass work and architectural engineering; it’s a mundane effect rather than a magical one.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The deed specifies the property is a total of 1 acre, but the low, wrought-iron fence surrounding the yard is rusted\n    and dilapidated.

The loss of his parents set Ortagar on a path of\n    greater understanding about the world and his role in it. He considers himself fortunate and, insomuch as his faith\n    permits it, happy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Other likely topics of conversation include the Blood Lords, @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18105graydi.JournalEntryPage.05berlinehaldo00]{Berline Haldoli}, and the player characters’\n    recent adventures. Regarding the Blood Lords, Ortagar has little to say. They generally take little interest in\n    @Compendium[pf2e.deities.ZfN7jkK6boU1FuiS]{Zon-Kuthon's} teachings, which suits Ortagar; the envy of such arrogant and powerful creatures is a dangerous\n    thing. Ortagar freely admits he has no interest in becoming an undead. His place is at the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18105graydi.JournalEntryPage.05emptythresho00]{Empty Threshold}, where he\n    hopes to be important enough to his congregation that his eventual death causes them great suffering. Beyond that,\n    he has few ambitions aside from faithfully serving the Midnight Lord.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Ortagar has much more respect for Berline than for the other Blood Lords. It’s rare for a Blood Lord to choose\n    to retain life rather than seek the all-too-common embrace of undeath. Ortgagar and Berline share interest in\n    delicious food and have refined many recipes together throughout the years. Their frequent meals also offer an\n    excuse for them to share the experience of being powerful citizens of Graydirge who are nonetheless living people.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    If the player characters discuss the Kuthite priest’s body in the basement of Qhallaqh Manor with Ortagar, he\n    recalls one of his priests, a man named Menetgash, went missing about two years ago. Ortagar can confirm it is the\n    body of Menetgash if the characters describe it. He doesn’t know why Menetgash visited Qhallaqh Manor or how\n    the priest ended up dead. If the characters describe the ornate key they found, or show it to him, Ortagar says the\n    key doesn’t belong to him or to the Empty Threshold. He suspects the key belongs to @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18103marrow.JournalEntryPage.03graydirgeban00]{Graydirge Bank}, which\n    closed about two years ago, around the time Menetgash went missing. He genuinely does not know why one of his\n    priests would possess such a key, but he asks the player characters to let him know if they find out.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Impressing Ortagar:</strong> During the meal, allow each player character to attempt a skill check to earn\n    Ortagar’s favor. The base DC of these checks is 17. The appropriate skill should be something that arises\n    naturally from the characters’ interactions and conversations, such as a @Check[type:diplomacy|dc:17|name:Impress Ortagar] check if they are being\n    friendly, or a @Check[type:religion|dc:17|name:Impress Ortagar] check if they speak about Zon-Kuthon or other faith-related topics. If at least half the\n    party succeeds at these checks, or if any character critically succeeds, the party impresses Ortagar enough that he\n    offers to have his acolytes teach them the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18107toolbo.JournalEntryPage.07kuthitespell00]{Kuthite Spells} at the characters’ convenience.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Ortagar’s Mission:</strong> Eventually, Ortagar decides he can trust the characters with more\n    information. At an appropriate moment in the conversation, read or paraphrase the following.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"read-aloud\">\n    <img class=\"float-right\" src=\"modules/pf2e-ap181-zombie-feast/assets/art/PZO90181_ORTAGAR-STITCH-SKULL.webp\" alt=\"bald human with stithed scars on top of his head\" style=\"shape-outside: url('modules/pf2e-ap181-zombie-feast/assets/art/PZO90181_ORTAGAR-STITCH-SKULL.webp')\">\n    <p>\n      Ortagar closes his eyes as he enjoys one final morsel before gently returning his napkin and spoon to the table.\n      He methodically straightens them as he clears his throat.

Later, I must pay for the pleasure this meal has brought me,” he\n      says with a glance at his spoon, “but for now, we have important matters to discuss.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “I recently learned of an apparent plot to introduce some strange substance—poisons, perhaps—to\n      Geb’s food supply. This plot involved not just any remote farm, where the food would undoubtedly be shipped\n      overseas and be no concern of mine, but a farm that supplies Graydirge itself, including this temple. You all know\n      of what I speak, of course. I have a confession to make, about why I have brought you all here. Word of this plot\n      did not reach me by way of our mutual acquaintance, the esteemed Reanimator, Mistress Berline Haldoli. No. I\n      learned of this plot from a member of my own congregation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “It is difficult for our worshippers to keep secrets from us. My acolytes are quite skilled, and it is easy\n      to recognize when one of our own has grown accustomed to our ministrations and requires extra attention. One such\n      congregant is a man named Dakramat, who is also a member of a Graydirge gang called the Bone Shards. We’ve\n      long known Dakramat worked with the Bone Shards, but it did not concern us. It is a pathetic group, little more\n      than struggling ruffians, unworthy of our attention—or so I assumed. It seems the group has a new leader.\n      This individual plots to poison Graydirge’s food supply. Dakramat heard about this from his gang’s new\n      leader, but as he wasn’t in the inner circle, he couldn’t provide any details, even under intense\n      interrogation. Our modest congregation consists mostly of living people, and there are many other quick across\n      Graydirge. A mass poisoning is no trifling matter.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      “When word of what happened at Old Ergagh’s Farm reached me, it was clear there truly is a plot\n      against Graydirge... against its living residents, at least. I try to keep myself and the Empty Threshold\n      insulated from such schemes, and I’d appreciate external assistance with this investigation. Thus, I have\n      brought you here to share what I know. The Bone Shards are somehow connected to what has happened, and what may\n      yet happen, if no one acts. I can tell you where their hideout is. Try not to kill all of them. If they have\n      information on this plot, we ought to learn who is involved.”\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  <p>\n    After dinner concludes, the player characters have a couple of leads to pursue. They can choose to proceed first to\n    the Bone Shards hideout or to Graydirge Bank. Ortagar can give them directions to the Bone Shards hideout, which he\n    learned by interrogating Dakramat (Dakramat is no longer in any position to speak with the characters, or anyone\n    else). Graydirge Bank may be abandoned, but its location is well known, and Ortagar’s acolytes provide\n    directions if needed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> Award the player characters 30 XP for learning about the key and the poisoning plot over\n    dinner with Ortagar. Award them an additional 30 XP if they impressed Ortagar with their conversation.\n  </p>\n\n"

Many of Graydirge’s aristocrats and\n    merchants count on the Bone Shards to enable their constant scheming against one another. These petty quarrels are\n    nowhere near the level of the Blood Lords’ machinations, but the Bone Shards’ strategy of playing both\n    sides has soured its relationship with more than one local tyrant. The Bone Shards have managed to avoid the\n    destructive wrath of those they’ve worked against only by being useful to enough other groups that it would\n    cause more trouble than it’s worth to eliminate the pathetic gang.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Bone Shards’ only other advantage is that they’ve managed to spread a rumor that their members are\n    fetchlings who ward the hideout with powerful shadow magic. A few gang members worship @Compendium[pf2e.deities.ZfN7jkK6boU1FuiS]{Zon-Kuthon} (including\n    Dakramat), and they supported this ruse with their knowledge of the Shadow Plane. With some mundane disguises, the\n    gang kept the rumor going for several months.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Recently, the gang’s fate changed. @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18107toolbo.JournalEntryPage.07kepgedatheha00]{Kepgeda the Hag-Nailed}, leader of the Three-Fingered Hand, is no stranger\n    to fetchlings and shadow magic. Shortly after she set up shop in Graydirge, she investigated the Bone Shards’\n    rumors and recognized their claims of Shadow Plane ties were utter fabrications. Kepgeda saw this as an affront to\n    her mother’s work. She knew she could easily wipe out the gang, but her actual business in\n    Graydirge—helping the Graveclaw perfect an insidious poison—distracted her from this idle act of\n    destruction.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    While researching the tremor paste the Graveclaw’s operatives in Sallowshore sent to Graydirge, Kepgeda\n    learned it was still sequestered in Graydirge Bank, which had closed. Furthermore, access to the lockboxes in the\n    bank vault required special, ornate keys. After lengthy investigation, Kepgeda learned the Bone Shards had come into\n    possession of just such a key. Using persuasive techniques she learned from her mother that would make even Kuthites\n    flinch, she convinced the Bone Shards they’d be better off if she were in charge.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Kepgeda couldn’t stand the Bone Shards’ pretentions, so she didn’t rely on them for long. Now\n    informed of their headquarters and its secrets, she stamped them out by recruiting most of them into her\n    Three-Fingered Hand gang, dead or alive (mostly dead). After all, how dare they play pretend with shadow magic?\n    Surely, Kepgeda thought, Iron Taviah would be pleased she punished them. Besides, she needed the key to Graydirge\n    Bank, and she didn’t care to explain why she needed it. All things considered, it seemed more expedient to\n    just murder the Bone Shards.\n  </p>\n\n"

This massive\n    chamber once served as a flesh rendering site, where necromancers used a powerful ritual to strip flesh from bones,\n    scouring away the souls of the ritual’s victims in the process. The ritual supplied Graydirge with countless\n    thousands of bones in short order, while also preventing the mass death from producing haunts or lingering spirits.\n    Geb has plenty of such dangers already, and the city’s necromancer-architects desired to live in the city\n    without being devoured by vengeful ghosts.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The flesh rendering site was once a prominent fixture of the city, but as it fell into disuse, few people remembered\n    where to find it.

Kepgeda was enraged by the Bone Shards pretending to be\n      fetchlings, insisting “shadow magic isn’t a thing for playing pretend.” They emphasize her\n      obsession with “putting her enemies to better use,” such as by cooking them or raising them as\n      zombies.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Kepgeda raised several dead Bone Shards as zombies to join her ranks, and cooked “the leftovers” (her\n      words) into Bone Shard soup in the vault to the east (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18103marrow.JournalEntryPage.03bonevault00000]{C4}).

Dakramat was among the most devout, and the gang members\n      assume he quit the gang to join the acolytes full time.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      If characters ask about the corpse and key they discovered in Qhallaqh Manor, the Bone Shards know nothing about\n      either.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> If the characters resolve this interaction through nonviolent means, award them XP as if\n    they had defeated the Bone Shards in combat.

These granite vultures are a\n      fiendish imitation of guardian beasts (<em>Pathfinder Bestiary 3</em> 124). Rather than protecting sacred\n      entryways, they guard profane treasures and sites of great evil. They’re usually dormant unless provoked.\n      The vultures awoke from their torpor when the Three-Fingered Hand members pillaged the vaults and attacked. Some\n      of the gang members fended off the vultures with @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.T8EopYZLT137CsdW]{Nets} while\n      others went for the vaults.

However, they have one advantage typical guardian beasts lack: a linked back-up receptacle\n      can reconstitute their bodies even if their vessel is destroyed. The large granite skulls serve as these back-up\n      receptacles (as well as their perches).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The granite vultures assault the player characters on sight, assuming they are robbers like the ones here\n      recently. They fight until destroyed, which hurls their essence into the spirit receptacles (the skulls). Though\n      the vultures’ instinct is to fight, the characters might delay their attack with quick conversation and\n      skillful lies.

They wonder what names taste like.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      They like to sample corpses that have aged for varying periods of time. No one feeds them, as they cannot ingest\n      food.

She has a\n      secret vault to the south; there’s a lever in the wall. Maybe she hides tasty things in it.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      The vultures want to know what the characters taste like. They can taste things in their skull vessels just as\n      well as in their vulture vessels.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Other people came here recently. They wore red cloaks and did not stay long. A few of them trapped the vultures in\n      nets while the others took several boxes from the vaults. Neither the visitors nor the boxes smelled good.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      The people who came here recently smelled heavily of yeast. They referred to what they came to steal as “the\n      ingredient.” It was for someone called “the poisoner,” who was apparently worried the ingredient\n      might have spoiled after so much time in the bank.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Something in the northeast vault (area @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18103marrow.JournalEntryPage.03prisonvault000]{D17}) likes to hiss and snarl a lot.

A corpse lies near a chest with a torn label in the far corner.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    These chests and lockboxes once stored a great deal of wealth from other parts of Geb, but the vault was emptied\n    when the bank closed. However, the bankers left a single heavy, nondescript chest because they couldn’t find\n    any record of who owned the chest or when it appeared in the vault. Their only clue was a torn label, and they did\n    not have time to follow up on it. They shoved the chest in a corner and forgot about it. The Graveclaw—a coven\n    of hags of which Kepgeda’s mother, Iron Taviah, is a member—sent this chest from Sallowshore and paid\n    for it to be deposited in secret. The coven didn’t anticipate the bank’s sudden closure.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Three-Fingered Hand accessed this vault using the key from the Bone Shards and found the chest. With their\n    numbers dwindling from the guards and traps in the bank, the gang members stole the contents—several jars of\n    tremor paste—rather than attempt to lift the lead-lined chest itself.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Some of the robbers had secret orders direct from Kepgeda. To ensure they’d found the correct substance, she\n    instructed them to test the tremor paste by combining it with a small sample of brain grit and feeding it to an\n    unsuspecting low-ranking gang member.

The journal dates back only a couple of weeks.\n    Most of the entries describe the mundane details of the man’s life: the weather, people to avoid, shopping\n    lists of cheap goods, and the like. It’s clear the man was down on his luck and desperate for some lucrative\n    opportunity to improve his fortunes. A more recent entry has the heading “New Job” and a simple sketch\n    of several complicated street intersections. This is a quick map the man created of a small portion of the Court of\n    Ghouls district between the city’s east gate and the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18104spoile.JournalEntryPage.04thecrookedco00]{The Crooked Coffin} Brewery and Tavern (both of which are\n    marked) to keep from getting lost in the mazelike market when approaching the gang headquarters. Anyone who has\n    spent some time in Graydirge recognizes the area depicted on the map and can easily find the Crooked Coffin.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Investigating the Chest:</strong> Although the robbers emptied the chest, the characters can still learn\n    from it. One of the jars had an imperfect seal, and some residue leaked into the bottom of the chest. If the\n    characters previously found the tremor paste at the farm, or if Berline found it and later told them about it, the\n    characters immediately recognize this residue comes from the same paste.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A torn label on the chest indicates it was shipped from someplace called “Sallows.” (In fact, this once\n    read “Sallowshore.”) This information is not immediately useful to the characters, but Sallowshore is a\n    location they are bound to visit during the next volume of the Adventure Path.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award: </strong>If the player characters find the chest with the torn label, identify or collect the\n    residue, and surmise this was what the Three-Fingered Hand was after, award them 80 XP.\n  </p>\n\n"

She paid an exorbitant sum\n      to the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League} to craft a trapdoor in the ceiling that would open 1\n      minute after the door to this vault is opened unless someone speaks a magical passphrase. The door blends almost\n      seamlessly with the ceiling, and a character spots it only if they succeed at a\n      @Check[type:perception|dc:30|traits:action:search,secret|name:Search] check when\n      @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.TiNDYUGlMmxzxBYU]{Searching} the room.

Most of the notes pertain to the\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06taxcollector00]{Tax Collectors Union}, the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League}, and the\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06celebrants0000]{Celebrants}.

Beyond this basic information, little of what Tylegmut recorded is accurate, and a\n    player character who succeeds at a @Check[type:society|dc:11] check quickly realizes these are the vague,\n    disorganized, contradictory writings of a self-absorbed conspiracy theorist. Tylegmut rambles about unproven links\n    between the Great Factions: that the Builder’s League is connected with strange insectile creatures from deep\n    below the surface, that multiple factions are secretly controlled by\n    @Compendium[pf2e.deities.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasmin} dissidents, and more. She states facts and assumptions that\n    are obviously inaccurate and draws conclusions that prove her other theories&nbsp;wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Among the documents, the player characters also discover a recent journal detailing Tylegmut’s plans to take\n    advantage of what she’d ascertained with her research. She was obsessed with finding out some sort of secret\n    contract from the bank’s founding.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Tylegmut contacted the Builders League, carefully concealing her efforts from the Tax Collectors Union (though she\n    was certain they were onto her by the end). The Builders League rejected her offer to spy for it in exchange for\n    secrets. She tried the Celebrants next—she even pretended to worship\n    @Compendium[pf2e.deities.22n3N47sqbqbDxbp]{Urgathoa}—and they accepted. She helped them arrange to close the\n    bank. She looked forward to working with a new Great Faction, one that would be interested in secrets around the\n    bank’s founding. If the characters investigated the manager’s office on the ground floor (area\n    @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18103marrow.JournalEntryPage.03managersoffi00]{D5}), they know the Celebrants had no interest in a permanent relationship with\n    Tylegmut, and the Tax Collectors Union had caught on to her scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Berline Haldoli’s response to this information, should the characters decide to share it with her, is\n    described in @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18104spoile.JournalEntryPage.04spoiledrotte00]{Chapter 3}.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>XP Award:</strong> Award the characters 30 XP for discovering Tylegmut’s notes and learning of her\n    fanciful conspiracies regarding the Great Factions.\n  </p>\n\n"

She was not aware of Tylegmut’s affiliations with so many Great Factions, but based on\n    what the characters discovered, it seems the bank manager was in well over her head. Berline dispenses some serious\n    advice: the Great Factions are not to be trifled with, and while they all have Geb’s best interests in mind,\n    they are often at odds with each other. Favoring one often means slighting another. While it’s possible,\n    it’s quite difficult to establish and maintain extensive relationships with several different Great Factions\n    at once, as evidenced by Tylegmut’s fate. As for Tylegmut’s conspiracies, none of them seem all that\n    plausible to Berline, though she confides, “This is Geb, after all.

From time to time, they also seek to tarnish the reputation of specific Blood Lords\n    or even the other Great Factions, if necessary. The secretive nature of the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League}, in particular, often\n    angers the Celebrants, who distrust anyone who withholds information from Geb’s “public relations”\n    division.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    With practically unlimited funding, the Celebrants have agents stationed across Geb who serve not only to spread\n    propaganda at every opportunity, but to listen for dissent and discontent. Anyone who speaks out against Geb (the\n    nation or the ruler), especially in public, risks being reported to the authorities and arrested as a traitor. The\n    subsequent interrogations often lead to further arrests. Once they’ve determined how to manipulate the public\n    into viewing the dissenters as vile heathens and blasphemers, the Celebrants arrange for them to be tortured and\n    executed—in full view of the public, of course, and preferably during a feast.\n  </p>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Celebrants</h1>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait alignment\">LE</li>\n    <li class=\"trait size\">Medium</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">Governmental</li>\n  </ul>\n  <em>Gluttonous priests overseeing public events and propaganda</em>\n  <p><strong>Scope and Influence</strong> national (Geb)</p>\n  <p><strong>Goals</strong> celebrate and promote Geb by organizing massive events and controlling public perception</p>\n  <p><strong>Headquarters</strong> Cathedral of Epiphenomena (Mechitar)</p>\n  <p><strong>Allies</strong> informants, public figures, worshippers of Urgathoa</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Enemies</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League}, dissenters, those who keep secrets from the government or oppose the\n    Celebrants’ propaganda\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Assets</strong> contacts, financing, influence</p>\n  <p><strong>Membership Requirements</strong> undergo conditioning at the Cathedral of Epiphenomena</p>\n  <p><strong>Accepted Alignments</strong> NE (CE, LE, LN, N)</p>\n  <p><strong>Values</strong> celebrations of Geb, devotion to Urgathoa, gluttony</p>\n  <p><strong>Anathema</strong> abstinence, moderation, spreading damaging information about Geb</p>\n  </aside>\n\n"

Many members are younger or less traditional than those of some other Great Factions, such as\n    the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League} and @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06taxcollector00]{Tax Collectors Union}, yet the Export Guild is filled with staunch loyalists and\n    nationalists. In their minds, going against Geb’s traditions is a good thing if doing so helps Geb extend its\n    international reach or solidify its economic or political power. While they inevitably prioritize their own selfish\n    interests in many dealings, Export Guild members frequently consider the costs and benefits to Geb as a whole in\n    their decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Management of Ossum Harbor in Mechitar falls to the Export Guild. This harbor is relatively small but vital to\n    Geb’s foreign relations, as it’s the primary outlet for the nation’s food exports. Most foreigners\n    enter Geb via Ossum Harbor, and the Export Guild works with the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06celebrants0000]{Celebrants} to ensure that important visitors receive\n    appropriate honors and accolades on their arrival. As the harbor’s staff is made up almost entirely of the\n    city’s massive underclass, these events often require the harbor to shut down its operations for a few hours\n    when especially important visitors arrive, lest the slovenly workers disgust new arrivals. The Export Guild presents\n    these lost hours to workers as “time off” but doesn’t pay them and generally doesn’t\n    decrease quotas accordingly. Workers who fall behind—or who dare show up during hours when they’re\n    supposed to remain unseen—are generally carted off to Geb’s interior to work its farms, if they’re\n    ever seen again at all.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Export Guild has a complicated relationship with the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06reanimators000]{Reanimators}. The latter faction’s ostentatious\n    necromancy, which hurts Geb’s image among other nations, is nonetheless necessary for the creation of most of\n    Geb’s workforce, including the zombies and other laborers responsible for food production, which remains\n    Geb’s most profitable foreign export. The Export Guild recently began encouraging the Reanimators to find ways\n    to move food production out of sight of Geb’s busiest cities, or perhaps even underground, but the issue of\n    funding such a massive infrastructure project also involves the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League} (who would approve and manage the\n    project), the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06celebrants0000]{Celebrants} (who would manage the public perception of the project), and the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06taxcollector00]{Tax Collectors Union} (who\n    would fund it). The involvement of all five of Geb’s Great Factions in a single large-scale issue often\n    indicates that the planning alone is bound to take decades. For a variety of reasons, some of the Great Factions\n    have buried this project in an overwhelming tide of bureaucratic red tape. The Export Guild’s leaders are at a\n    loss as to why, but they know it’s only a matter of time before they learn their\n    rivals’&nbsp;motivations.\n  </p>\n  <aside class=\"sidebar\">\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Export Guild</h1>\n  <ul class=\"traits\">\n    <li class=\"trait alignment\">LE</li>\n    <li class=\"trait size\">Medium</li>\n    <li class=\"trait\">Governmental</li>\n  </ul>\n  <em>Managers of foreign trade</em>\n  <p><strong>Scope and Influence</strong> national (Geb) and regional (Impossible Lands)</p>\n  <p><strong>Goals</strong> broaden and strengthen Geb’s foreign relations, govern foreign exports and imports</p>\n  <p><strong>Headquarters</strong> Ossum Harbor (Mechitar)</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Allies</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06celebrants0000]{Celebrants}, foreigners interested in dealing with Geb, influential artisans and merchants\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Enemies</strong> @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06reanimators000]{Reanimators}, isolationists, pirates, those who tarnish Geb’s image</p>\n  <p><strong>Assets</strong> armaments, contacts, financing, influence, transport</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Membership Requirements</strong> demonstrate loyalty to Geb, including passing an extensive background check\n    regarding potential foreign entanglements\n  </p>\n  <p><strong>Accepted Alignments</strong> LE (LN, NE)</p>\n  <p><strong>Values</strong> lucrative trade deals, relations with foreign nations</p>\n  <p>\n    <strong>Anathema</strong> damaging Geb’s image or reputation, impeding the exchange of goods and ideas, jeopardizing\n    foreign relations, mistreating important visitors\n  </p>\n  </aside>\n\n"

However, few question their importance to Geb, nor\n    their necromantic might—though they don’t frequently wield it outside their established\n    responsibilities. While few people know the exact number, most Blood Lords recognize that the Reanimators control\n    untold numbers of mindless undead spread across Geb’s countryside. The possibility that they might one day use\n    their “workforce” for something beyond farming isn’t often uttered but is always at the back of\n    other faction leaders’ minds when they think of the Reanimators.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Most of the Reanimators, and especially the Blood Lords who eagerly align themselves with the faction, are\n    necromancers, but many serve the faction only in an administrative capacity or as corpse tenders out on the farms.\n    Few engage in necromantic animation on a daily basis. The Reanimators also retain a small number of officers whose\n    primary responsibility is to enforce the law requiring anyone who dies on Geb’s soil to be reanimated as\n    undead to serve the state. In their patrols across Geb, these officers—informally called Dead\n    Solicitors—also watch for any signs of the use or presence of positive energy, which they’re authorized\n    to stamp out using any means necessary.

The faction maintains a headquarters in Graydirge, and each regional\n    authority must submit regular production updates to the central office. However, barring large-scale disruptions or\n    labor shortages, the faction’s leaders are content to leave one another alone.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Reanimators resent the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06taxcollector00]{Tax Collectors Union}, who levy heavy taxes on their crop shipments and tend to show\n    disdain for the Reanimators’ “dirty work” of raising zombies and growing food.

The Tax Collectors Union likes to keep it that way.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Several prominent aristocrats and bankers make up the upper echelons of the Tax Collectors Union, with most of the\n    faction’s other members being part of their extended families, their employees, or both.

The\n    Celebrants’ flaunting of wealth irritates the Union, whose leaders view any displays of wealth from outside\n    the Union as threats to their economic superiority. In the rare event that individuals outside the ranks of the\n    Blood Lords rise to prominence in Geb, the Tax Collectors Union keeps careful watch on its coffers—and\n    coffins—paranoid that anyone seeking to make a name for themselves in Geb must be after their money, their\n    ancient titles, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Of the other factions, the Tax Collectors Union is most accepting of the @UUID[JournalEntry.pf2ap18106factio.JournalEntryPage.06buildersleag00]{Builders League}, which it largely views as\n    fellow even-handed traditionalists.

A necromunculus may be loyal to its master, but it also seethes with hatred for all undead, including itself.\n    If left to its own devices, a necromunculus immediately begins plotting to kill and gnaw upon any undead with whom\n    it must regularly interact, even its master, even though it has no need to eat.

Skull fairies take heads they’ve acquired to\n    isolated caves, where they carefully strip off the flesh and put the skulls on display.

Even their putrid, trumpeting\n    blasts resonate in a way that doesn’t harm other zombies.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc split\">\n    <span>Dirge Piper</span><span>Creature 3</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>@Compendium[pf2e.blood-lords-bestiary.LRHYWNJg7231HUOc]{See Actor here}</p>\n\n"

Fanatically devoted to her mother, but starved for attention, she hungers\n    for the power that would satisfy her mother’s demands.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Kepgeda is a changeling and the daughter of Iron Taviah, an annis hag who lives in a shadowy cottage in the Axan\n    Wood. Under the twisted trees of this haunted forest in central Geb, Iron Taviah raised Kepgeda from a young age to\n    serve her faithfully. Occult magic and necromancy came naturally to Kepgeda. She suspects this is one of the reasons\n    Iron Taviah raised her, rather than sending Kepgeda away or locking her up, like her less-talented siblings. She\n    doesn’t know their fate, but she suspects it was unpleasant.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    But Kepgeda never questions her mother about her siblings, her father, and certainly not why she, of all her\n    siblings, was allowed to serve. Kepgeda loves Iron Taviah. Deep in her heart, she knows that she should hate the\n    hag. She should hate the way she was raised. She should hate the vile things her mother expected of her. She should\n    hate that she is still alive not because she is Iron Taviah’s child, but because she is Iron Taviah’s\n    useful servant. But she loves her mother nonetheless. She loves every cruel thing Iron Taviah did to her that helped\n    harden Kepgeda against the terrors of Geb. She even loves that her mother took a finger from her left hand and keeps\n    its bones in a tattered leather pouch as a form of occult insurance against her daughter. Kepgeda loves that Iron\n    Taviah is filled with hatred for all people, including Kepgeda herself. So, she didn’t question when Iron\n    Taviah sent her to help poison the people of Graydirge.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Away from the sheltering shadows of the Axan Wood and the protection of her mother, Kepgeda knew it safest to form a\n    coven of her own. Her mother, after all, was part of a coven, though Kepgeda rarely met its other members, and then\n    only at a distance. So Kepgeda sought out two companions. It didn’t take long to find others living in\n    Graydirge with an interest in foul necromancy and occultism. Kepgeda’s new “sisters” included a\n    dhampir human witch named Samaygdi and an aging human necromancer named Naunylet. Neither of them lived up to her\n    expectations, so Kepgeda dismembered and cooked each of her sisters alive. She bound their screaming souls to the\n    cauldron they’d shared. Now, she draws on their souls’ power to fuel her necromancy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    One day, Kepgeda hopes to return to the Axan Wood having surpassed her mother in power, and join the Graveclaw\n    herself. She’s begun to have thoughts of murdering Iron Taviah, but she hates these thoughts and tries to\n    drown them out by spending as much time near her constantly screaming cauldron as possible. In the meantime, Kepgeda\n    pushes her followers in the Three-Fingered Hand to make every sacrifice necessary to poison Graydirge. This gang\n    consists of a few humans and ghouls who initially followed Kepgeda out of fear; as she helped them overcome rivals\n    and expand their operations, they’ve steadily gained respect for her. The gang’s recent catastrophic\n    losses at Old Ergagh’s Farm and Graydirge Bank threaten to undo everything Kepgeda has worked for, and the\n    gang waits tensely to see what will happen next. Kepgeda and her poisoner, Pesgahi, could perfect another poison and\n    concoct a new plan to introduce it to Graydirge’s food supply. Or she might murder them all out of spite and\n    start over with a new gang.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc\">Campaign Role</h1>\n  <p>\n    Kepgeda is the primary villain of this adventure and is unlikely to survive her encounter with the player\n    characters—and her vengeful sisters—at the conclusion of Chapter 3.\n  </p>\n  <h1 class=\"no-toc split\">\n    <span>Kepgeda the Hag-Nailed</span><span>Creature 5</span>\n  </h1>\n  <p>@Compendium[pf2e.blood-lords-bestiary.5pfU6ZAyAWq3VEdq]{See Actor here}</p>\n  \n"
